They are slightly longer than tall, with oval feet and bushy tails which hang over the back. \r\n\r\nCoat: The American Eskimo Dog has a two-layered coat. The undercoat is short and dense, and the outer coat consists of long straight hair. The coat is thicker and longer around the chest and neck, giving the appearance of a mane.

The American English Coonhound was developed from the â€œVirginia Houndsâ€ when men such as the first president of the United States, George Washington, set out to create a hound that was better suited to the rougher terrain. The breed was used for all variations of hunting, including treeing, and were regularly utilized to hunt raccoon and American Red Fox. The Treeing Walker Coonhound and the Bluetick Coonhound were lumped into the breed originally, but received separate recognition in the 1940"s. The American English Coonhound became recognized by the UKC in 1905, but was not fully recognized by the AKC until 2011.\r\n\r\nSize: The American English Coonhound male can reach heights of 22-27 inches tall, while the female is only slightly smaller reaching heights of 21-25 inches. The weight of the American English Coonhound should be proportionate to their height, but will typically range from 40-65 pounds.\r\n\r\nCoat: The American English Coonhound"s coat is short and hard and this breed is an average shedder. Their coat can come in a variation of colors. This can include blue and white ticked, red and white ticked, tri-colored with ticking, red and white and white and black. Red or black coloring in excess is considered a fault in regards to showing.\r\n\r\nCharacter: The American English Coonhound is pleasant and sociable. It has strong hunting instincts, great speed and an excellent voice. They possess strong prey drive and they also have a strong instinct for treeing animals. It is due to this that this breed is not recommended for homes with small animals. They will think of them as prey to be treed! The American English Coonhound will do better around older children, but can become accustomed to small children as well. This breed needs to be well socialized at a young age to avoid possible dog aggression or wariness of strangers.

The Alaskan Malamutes were bred for size and power to assist in hauling the bodies of seals and polar bears back to the village. They performed an essential function and became valued workers and companions. The Alaskan Malamute was endangered by interbreeding during the Alaskan gold rush of 1896, but was rescued by a breeder and Alaskan Malamute enthusiast in New England in the 1920â€™s, and thereafter increased in popularity. Alaskan Malamutes achieved fame by assisting in Admiral Byrdâ€™s trek to the South Pole in 1933 and served as pack dogs and search-and-rescue dogs in World War II. They are the prototypical strong, unrelenting sled dog. \r\n\r\nSize: Alaskan Malamutes have a shoulder height of 58-63.5 cm (23-25 in) and weighs 34-38.5 kg (75-85 lbs). With broad heads and heavy bones, they are built for pulling weight. Alaskan Malamutes have large muzzles, brown, almond shaped eyes, and triangular, rounded ears. They have straight backs and large feet, with plumed tails which curl over the back. â€œGiantâ€ Malamutes which weigh over 140 lbs are sometimes bred, but not as show dogs.

The coat is either pure white or a mixture of white with grey, sable, black, or red, with white legs and muzzle. Alaskan Malamutes grow their coat in winter and shed in spring.\r\n\r\nCharacter: The Alaskan Malamute is friendly, affectionate, and loyal, but can have a mind of its own. They are energetic like puppies for many years, but mellow out in older age. Alaskan Malamutes bond very closely with their master. They donâ€™t mind living outdoors as long as sufficient human companionship is available. Alaskan Malamutes are generally quiet, but may howl, and are fond of digging.\r\n\r\nTemperament: Alaskan Malamutes generally get along well with children, especially older children. Their friendliness makes them somewhat unsuitable as watchdogs. The Alaskan Malamute should be watched around smaller breeds or other pets due to a strong prey instinct. They may be aggressive towards other Alaskan Malamutes of the same gender. Early socialization is important to help the Alaskan Malamute get along with other pets.\r\n\r\nCare: The Alaskan Malamute does not require frequent grooming, but a good comb-out with a coarse comb is required when shedding.

These dogs remained in the Brooke family for nearly 300 years.\r\nGeorge Washington received French Foxhounds, Grand Bleu de Gascogne, (which look much like an American Bluetick Coonhound) as a gift from the Marquis de Lafayette. Many of the dogs Washington kept were descended from Brooke"s, and when crossed with the French hounds, helped to create the present day American Foxhound.\r\nThe American Foxhound is known to originate from the states of Maryland and Virginia, and is the state dog of Virginia.[1]\r\nThough there has long been a rumor that the new breed was originally used for hunting Indigenous peoples of the Americas, this is not true. The breed was developed by landed gentry purely for the sport of hunting foxes. With the importation (or migration) of the red fox, Irish Foxhounds were added to the lines, to increase speed and stamina in the dog, qualities still prevalent in today"s dogs. One quality that the American Foxhound is famous for is its musical howl that can be heard for miles. This is actually one reason that this breed does not do well in city settings.\r\nThe breed was first recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1886. Today, there are many different strains of American Foxhound, including Walker, Goodman, Trigg, July and Penn-Marydel. Though each strain looks quite different, they are all recognized as members of the same breed. Most show hounds are Walkers, many of the pack hounds (used with hunting foxes on horseback) are Penn-Marydel and hunters use a variety of strains to suit their hunting style and quarry.\r\n<b>Description</b>\r\nAppearance\r\nWhile standards call for the American Foxhound to be about 21â€“25 inches (530â€“640 mm) tall to the withers, and weigh anywhere between 45-60 pounds (29â€“34 kg), many of them are larger in structure (especially the show strains), with males standing 26â€“29 inches (660â€“740 mm) and females 25â€“28 inches (640â€“710 mm) and smaller in weight, typically between 40â€“65 pounds (20â€“29 kg). Some breeders have theorized that this is due to the considerably improved diet the dogs receive. For years it was traditional to feed Foxhounds on a diet of "dog bread", a variation on cornbread. The legs of a Foxhound are very long and straight-boned. The foxhound"s chest is rather narrow. It has a long muzzle, and a large, domed skull. The dog is a Virginia Common pet.The ears are wide and low-set. The eyes are hazel or brown, and are large and wide-set.\r\n<b>Coat</b>\r\nThe coat is short and harsh. Overall, they are very similar to the Beagle, only standing higher and being larger. Their coats come in four colors: red, tri, black and tan, and blue. American Foxhounds do tend to shed a good amount of hair, but a weekly brushing will decrease shedding.\r\n Defining Physical Characteristics\r\nThe American Foxhound is taller and bonier when compared to its cousin, the English Foxhound. Also, this breed is known to have a musical bark when it is hunting that can be heard for miles. If competing in a dog show, some physical characteristics that judges would look for would be a domed skull, large eyes, straight muzzle, muscular shoulders, arched toes, and a slightly curved tail.\r\n<b>Behavior</b>\r\nTemperament\r\nThe American Foxhound is gentle, easygoing, and gets along with children and other animals.[2] However, they may act reserved when around strangers.\r\n<b>Activity Level</b>\r\nThe American Foxhound is a very active breed and very high energy. They require a lot of exercise and do best in habitats where they have room to run. If they live in a suburban area such as a neighborhood, they should have a fenced in yard and be taken on multiple walks daily.\r\n<b>Trainability</b>\r\nObedience training is essential for this breed due to their independence and natural instinct to follow a scent. A Foxhound who picks up a scent will follow it while ignoring commands; training requires patience and skill because of the breed"s independence and occasional stubborness.[2] Because of its strong hunting instinct, American Foxhounds should not be trusted off-lead. Most scent hounds are bred to give "voice", but the Foxhound does not make a good watchdog.\r\nHealth\r\nThis breed is not generally a breed that carries genetic disorders. However they can easily become overweight if being overfed. A minor health risk in American Foxhounds is thrombocytopathy, or platelet disease.

They are also referred to as Chornyi, Terrier Noir Russe, Russian Bear Schnauzer, Black Terrier, Tchiorny Terrier, BRT and Stalin"s Dog. The Black Russian Terrier was created as a military working dog, bred to withstand the varying climate differences throughout the country. Several breeds were utilized in creating the Black Russian Terrier. These breeds included Airedale Terrier, Caucasian Ovcharka, Newfoundland, Giant Schnauzers, Standard Schnauzers and the Moscow Water Dog, which is now extinct. The Black Russian Terrier was bred for a working ability with little concern regarding appearance. Black Russian Terrier"s of today only vaguely resemble the original Black Russian Terrier. They received recognition from the FCI in 1984, but gained AKC recognition in 2004. \r\n\r\nSize: The male Black Russian Terrier can reach heights of 25-29 inches, while the female will reach heights of 25-28 inches. The breed can weigh in between 80-143 pounds, however, male Black Russian Terriers tend to appear a bit bigger than females. \r\n\r\nCoat: The coat of the Black Russian Terrier should always be black, while some individual gray hairs are expected and acceptable. Any white or brown within the coat is a disqualification. The coat will feel hard to the touch and is very dense. The hair on the face of the Black Russian Terrier should create what appears to be eyebrows and a beard. The Black Russian Terrier"s coat is a double coat that has a soft undercoat while the top coat is far coarser. \r\n\r\nCharacter: The Black Russian Terrier is a family oriented, affectionate, curious and protective breed. They will be eager to please their owner and will take direction well. However, it is important that you do not allow the Black Russian Terrier to do anything as a puppy that you may not want them to do as an adult, as these dogs are quite large and will want their way. The Black Russian Terrier makes an effective guard dog for their family, as they are suspicious of strangers and will instinctively protect the home as well as its inhabitants. However, if the Black Russian Terrier is left to live outside in a kennel, the dog could potentially become protective of its kennel, even against its owner. The Black Russian Terrier is quite curious and as a puppy will get into anything they can. It is imperative to give firm but loving redirection when this occurs. \r\n\r\nTemperament: The Black Russian Terrier is a very loving and energetic breed that loves to play with children well into adulthood. They constantly seek the attention of their family so if you are not available to the dog for long periods of time, this breed may not be for you. The Black Russian Terrier will do well with other non-dominant animals in the home. It is possible for a Black Russian Terrier to live in a home with another large male, but only if the owner has made themselves entirely dominant over both dogs. The pack master must exert dominance over this breed to ensure the dog is fully aware who the leader of the pack is. \r\n\r\nCare: The Black Russian Terrier requires a moderate amount of grooming. They should be brushed on a weekly basis and stripped if the coat is too soft. The beard and eyebrows should never be touched, however the body will need trimming 2-3 times per year. It will be necessary for you to remove hairs from the Black Russian Terrier"s ears as well as the underside of the paws. The Black Russian Terrier can live comfortably in an apartment with proper exercise. They will not be very active indoors, as they will most likely be following you wherever you go. \r\n\r\nTraining: The Black Russian Terrier is very eager to please and will learn quickly. They do require a firm and consistent pack master, but will respond better to a slightly more loving approach. It is necessary to begin training at a young age, as the Black Russian Terrier will grow to a relatively large size and may be more difficult to correct. The Black Russian Terrier must be made to know that they do not rank above the human members of its pack. When walking your Black Russian Terrier, it is imperative that the dog heel beside you and never lead. In the dog"s mind the leader is the one in front. \r\n\r\nActivity: The Black Russian Terrier is very playful and will enjoy outdoor play in a large area.

It is suggested that Bloodhounds get firm yet gentle obedience training. While they have a tendency to howl, snore and drool, they will get along well with other dogs and household pets. They may wander off if they pick up an interesting scent and also sniff inappropriately at times. They are able to follow any scent including that of a human which is rare ability for hound dogs. Their impeccable tracking abilities allow them to follow trails that may be over 100 hours old and their determination drives them to stick with a trail for 100 miles or more.

One entrant, Hemp, impressed all with his ability to manipulate sheep through his intense glare rather than with constant barking. Hemp went on to sire many pups, becoming the father of the modern Border Collie. By 1906, the first standard for Border Collies was written, which emphasized behavioral abilities over appearance. Border Collies were imported to America in the twentieth century, where they became popular working dogs and pets. Their speed and stamina makes them top competitors in dog sports such as Flyball and Frisbee.

Border Collies are average shedders.\r\n\r\nCharacter: Intelligent, determined and brave, the Border Collie forms a close bond with its family and is also eager to work (or play). Border Collies are exceptionally energetic, loving, and likeable.

It may get along more easily with dogs of the opposite sex. Border Collies should be socialized with small, non-canine pets when young to overcome the prey instinct. They may snap, especially as adolescents.\r\n\r\nCare: The Border Collie must have its coat brushed and combed weekly, but more often when shedding. Bathe only when necessary. Border Collies can live outside in cool or warm climates, provided sufficient companionship is provided.

Toward people they know, they will be affectionate and sweet. As hound dogs, they are a free-thinking breed who can be trained in obedience even though they are less willing to please humans than other breeds. For successful training, mutual respect must be the foundation of the training relationship and they are capable learners.

In the last century, Boxers have also been put to work as messenger dogs, guard dogs, cattle herders, and police dogs. \r\n\r\nSize: The Boxer has a shoulder height of 53-63 cm (21-25 in) and weighs 24-32 kg (53-70 lbs). Boxers are strong, compact, and agile, with broad powerful jaws and a small nose which enables it to breathe while hanging onto an animal. Boxers have docked tails and may have cropped ears. They have a distinctive head with long lower jaws and broad muzzles. The Boxerâ€™s head should be unwrinkled, with slight wrinkles on the forehead when concentrating. The Boxer has an arched skull, sloping shoulders, and high tail. Boxers carry themselves proudly.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Boxer has a short, smooth, shiny coat. It may be fawn (light tan, yellow, or light reddish), brindle (light/dark striped), or red. A black mask around the nose and jaws and white markings (â€œflashingsâ€) on the belly, chest, and feet are possible, but white should not cover more than a third of the Boxer. The Boxer is an average shedder.\r\n\r\nCharacter: The Boxer is happy, friendly, intelligent, attentive, and loyal. Boxers develop strong, close bonds with family. They have lots of energy and a serious demeanor, though they can be clownish and playful as well. They like to grab and carry around just about anything they can in their mouths. Boxers tend to get rowdy when the food bowl is empty. They make excellent guardians and companions.\r\n\r\nTemperament: The Boxer gets along especially well with children. They also get along well with other dogs and household pets, but may be aggressive towards unknown dogs. It is best if the Boxer undergoes early socialization due to its strong, boisterous personality. Female Boxers may fight each other on occasion. They are naturally inclined to protect you and your family from strangers. \r\n\r\nCare: The Boxerâ€™s coat can be kept in good condition by brushing occasionally to remove dead hair. The Boxer requires frequent human companionship. Boxers do not like excessively hot or cold weather and should not be left to live outdoors. Some Boxers may snore, drool or have flatulence. White Boxers are at higher risk of deafness. Boxers have an average lifespan of 10-12 years and will remain fit and athletic into old age. They have litters of 2-10 puppies.\r\n\r\nTraining: The Boxer must be trained not to jump up at people as it is naturally fond of jumping. The Boxer is ideal for various sporting activities because it can be highly trained and learns very quickly. Boxers may be stubborn in learning, but they are responsive to commands.\r\n\r\nActivity: The Boxer needs plenty of physical and mental exercise on a daily basis. They should be allowed to run or go for long walks regularly. Boxers enjoy playing fetch or other activities. They can tolerate apartment life if exercised sufficiently, but a fair-sized yard is ideal. Lonely, inactive Boxers can become stressed out and destructive.', 'boxer.jpg', 'Boxer', 'Country of Origin: The Boxer was bred in Germany from the Bulldog and the now extinct Bullenbeisser ("bull-biter").

The Briard is primarily a flock guard and herding dog, which is what it"s main purpose was up until World War I. The Briard"s use in World War I brought the breed nearly to extinction. They were utilized for many tasks such as running messages, delivering food and ammunition to the front lines, locating wounded soldiers, detecting mines and picking up trails. The Briard developed popularity in 1863 after the Paris dog show. The Briard became fully recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1928. This breed is still utilized as a flock guard, however, it has also taken on work with the military, police and search and rescue. The Briard may be an excellent working dog, but they are still considered wonderful family companions.\r\n\r\nSize: The Briard male will reach heights of 24-27 inches, while the female will reach a slight smaller height of 22-25 inches. The males can weigh anywhere between 75-100 pounds and the females will weigh between 50-65 pounds.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Briard has a double coat, which is a very rough and wiry outer coat and a fine close lying undercoat. The coarse outer coat has been compared to the coat of a goat. The coat is water and dirt resistant and will shed very little as long as it is properly groomed. The Briard"s coat can come in many color variations with the exception of white. The most common coat colors are black, gray and tawny. The gray and tawny coats may come in various shades and have been known to fade and darken with age.\r\n\r\nCharacter: The Briard is a very brave, intelligent and loyal breed. They will become very attached to their family very quickly and will often become quite protective of them. The Briard requires a good deal of attention from their owners, but will prefer play time before affection. The Briard was bred to accomplish their tasks on their own, and so this breed tends to be quite stubborn. It is necessary to be a very firm and consistent pack leader with this dog. The Briard will begin to take control if they believe the pack leader is faltering in their leadership. \r\n\r\nTemperament: The Briard is quite loving and affectionate with its family. They are typically very suspicious of strangers and will need to be introduced to anyone new on their terms. The Briard is known to do very well with children of any age as long as they are raised together. However, the Briard does not appreciate teasing. It is imperative that the Briard begin receiving regular socialization from a young age to assist in friendliness towards outsiders as well as towards other animals. They can display dog aggressive tendencies if not properly socialized. Even a Briard that has never seen a farm will have a modicum of herding ability and may attempt to herd humans by nipping at their heels. This behavior should be discouraged at a young age. \r\n\r\nCare: The Briard"s coarse coat requires regular weekly brushing to prevent matting.

This breed will be relatively easy to train, as they were intended to complete tasks without supervision or even direction. The Briard does require a firm hand when training, however, they will not respond well to anger and could become timid if frequently communicated to in anger. \r\n\r\nActivity: The Briard is by nature a working dog and will do best with a job to do.

It is a skilled bird hunter with excellent scenting abilities. The Brittanyâ€™s pointing and retrieving skills and high level of obedience made it popular among hunters, particularly poachers. Brittanys were first imported to North America in the 1920â€™s and recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1934 (the registered name was changed from â€˜Brittany Spanielâ€™ to â€˜Brittanyâ€™ in 1982, out of recognition of its more â€˜setterâ€™-like hunting style), but took a while to catch on popularity due to the absence of a long tail. The Brittany has slowly risen in popularity due to its small size, easygoing personality, and excellent hunting skills. It is today the most popular pointer in field trials.\r\n\r\nSize: The Brittany has a shoulder height of 43-53 cm (17-21 in) and weighs 14-18 kg (30-40 lbs). It has a brown or pink nose, small, highly set, triangular ears, and an alert expression. Brittanys are compact and muscular with long legs and naturally short or cropped tails up to 10 cm (4 in) in length. They are approximately as long as they are tall. Some breeders distinguish between â€˜American Brittanysâ€™, which are taller and faster for the wide American plains, and â€˜French Brittanysâ€™, which are more similar to Spaniels.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Brittany has a medium length, dense, flat or wavy coat with feathering on the legs. The most common color is white with orange markings. Other colors for Brittanys are white and liver, white and black, liver tricolored and black tricolored. Any pattern may be solid or roan with ticking. Some registries allow black Brittanys. \r\n\r\nCharacter: The Brittany is athletic, intelligent, quick and curious.

It is not unusual for a BG to be shy with strangers or new situations, and hang with his owner until he warms to what"s new. He barks when someone comes to the door or when appropriate. He doesn"t care for aggressive behavior, and if he can"t escape, he"ll defend himself. It is possible to find some Griffons who are hyperactive, and on the other end of the scale, some who are very mellow even shy. It"s best to visit the breeder and observe puppy and parent behavior. Male or female makes little difference in temperament. If you aren"t the leader, he can develop bad habits.\r\n\r\nDoes a Griffon make a good family dog?\r\nThe decision to have a dog has to be a "whole family" commitment not an experiment to teach children responsibility. Purchasing a Griffon is like having a baby that never grows up, but remains dependent for 12-15 years. A Griffon will bond with his caregiver. If he"s to be a family dog, everyone must help in care and training. The breed isn"t recommended for families with kids under 5 years.\r\n\r\nAre Brussels Griffons easy to train? " \r\n\r\nBrussels Griffons have a high degree of intelligence coupled with a sensitive nature. As a result, force does not work well with them in training; when forced they will decide they want no part of the training session. They will, however, respond well to guidance given with kindness, consistency and love. For example, catching a Griffon to crate them before leaving for work can result in a game of "catch me if you can" that can lead to frustration on the part of the owner. Enticing the Griffon into his crate with a treat elicits the desired behavior for you and a reward for the dog - a training win-win strategy that should be utilized consistently. \r\n\r\nGriffons will bond easily to their trainer when gentle training methods are used. Their intelligence and desire to please makes them wonderful participants in obedience, agility, conformation and tracking events. Leash training should begin by 6-8 weeks of age - Griffons can sometimes exhibit a stubborn streak when they first encounter a leash. Because of the Griffon"s small size and sensitive nature, they are not recommended as pets for small children that might be unwittingly rough or even tease the dog. They do make excellent pets for families with older children, singles, empty nesters or grandparents, in fact anyone with the commitment to the health and well being of their Griffon. \r\n\r\nThe innate wish for the Griffon to please you should be employed when housetraining your pet. Toy breeds can be difficult to housetrain - and the Brussels Griffon is no exception. If you would be heartbroken by a puddle on your oriental carpets, you may wish to consider another breed. Housetraining can be accomplished - however, it will not be as easy as with other breeds. Remember, consistency and kindness should always be employed, as well as keeping the Griffon on a regular schedule of "bathroom breaks". By keeping your Griffon on a regular schedule, and taking him outside immediately after waking up and after eating, your chances for successful housetraining will be improved. \r\n\r\nWhat is it like to live with a Brussels Griffon?" \r\n\r\nThe Griffon is a true "velcro dog" - he loves to be with you at all times. He will jump on your lap when you sit down, follow you into the bathroom, and even sit on your foot as you stand at the sink doing dishes! Because of their attachment to their family, Brussels Griffons are strictly house dogs. If relegated to a garage or kennel, the Griffon will pine away without love and personal attention, no matter how well their other needs are met. They should always have the opportunity to socialize with their people, otherwise they will become unhappy and withdraw into their shell. Griffons are happiest when they can sleep in your bed, follow you throughout your daily activities, and be an integral part of the family. \r\n\r\nGriffons get along well with other pets, and enjoy the companionship of their human and animal family members. A word of caution - due to their innate sense of self importance, they are not aware of their small stature. As a result, they will often try to dominate dogs many times their size and could be hurt by a larger pet. Griffons love to romp and play, and will often amuse you by tearing through the house and running in circles for the sheer joy of it. When playtime is through, they will curl up next to you for a nap, again showing that they are true velcro dogs.', '52706_BDAYJWeeVnctnvXec6v0DUf04WAznUSxhcVy67bbtBSg4xIg4E.jpg', 'Brussels Griffon', 'What', 'Brussels Griffon', 0);

It dates back to Biblical times, when it served as the guard dog and herd dog of the ancient Israelis. There are several references to working or stray dogs in the Bible which likely refer to the Canaan Dog. A sarcophagus from the fourth century BC depicts Alexander the Great hunting with a dog that appears to be a Canaan Dog. The origins of the Canaan Dog are unknown, but it likely descended from the spitz (an ancient breed of white, thick coated dogs). After the Roman invasion in the 2nd century, most Canaan Dogs became strays in the Negev Desert, though a few were enlisted as guard dogs by the nomadic Bedouins. In the 1930â€™s, Dr. Rudolphina Menzel recognized that existing guard dogs for Jewish settlements were not well suited to the harsh terrain, and had the idea of training these wild desert dogs. She was able to capture and earn the trust of several dogs, and found them to be easily trainable. By World War II, her Canaan Dogs were serving as messengers, sentries, and mine detectors. Dr. Menzel wrote the first standard for the breed and in 1965 sent the first Canaan Dogs to America. The Canaan Dog was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1997.\r\n\r\nSize: The Canaan Dog has a shoulder height of 48-61 cm (19-24 in) and weighs 16-25 kg (35-55 lbs). It has a long, wedge shaped head with almond shaped eyes, low set, upright ears and a level or scissors bite. Canaan Dogs come in an assortment of appearances. Dr. Menzel classified them into four types: heavy and sheepdog-like, lean and dingo-like, noble and Collie-like, and sleek and Greyhound-like. All have a short, arched loin region and bushy tail carried curled over the back when the dog is excited or alert.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Canaan Dog has a double coat consisting of a soft undercoat and straight, flat outer coat. The coat can be white with colored markings or black, brown, red, or cream, all with white markings. Canaan Dogs may have white or black masks covering the ears and eyes and a white blaze between the eyes. They shed heavily once a year.\r\n\r\nCharacter: The Canaan Dog is intelligent, docile, devoted, and willing to please. Because it is highly territorial, the Canaan Dog should be kept in a fenced yard and walked on a leash. \r\n\r\nTemperament: The Canaan Dog is generally good with other pets, but is somewhat aloof toward strangers and may be aggressive toward other dogs. It barks immediately at suspicious activity, making an excellent guard dog. The Canaan Dog is protective of its family.\r\n\r\nCare: The Canaan Dog must be brushed once a week to remove dead hair. Canaan Dogs are generally healthy, but may be susceptible to epilepsy or PRA (a retinal disorder). They have a lifespan of 12-15 years.\r\n\r\nTraining: The Canaan Dog is intelligent, making training a fairly simple process.

Cardigan Welsh Corgis are easily distinguishable from the Pembroke with their wide and wider set ears, as well as their long tail. Pembroke"s tails are docked completely, that is if they are even born with a tail. Cardigans reach one Welsh yard from nose tip to tail tip, which is why they are sometimes called "yard-long dogs". They have longer bodies than the Pembroke, and are much longer than they are tall. Their colors consist of red, sable, brindles, black, tricolor, and blue merle--which legend says came from fairies who brought the color in the night. They usually have white on them with an Irish pattern, but overbearing white is considered a severe fault. They are loving, intelligent, and are hard workers with their high quality obedience skills. They can often appear sprightly in character and are quite confident. Active and devoted, this little dog can be quite amusing in character and appearance at times.

The King Charles Spaniel was created by crossing small Spaniels with a short snouted breed such as the Pug or Japanese Chin. It was brought to Scotland from Continental Europe (possibly by Mary, Queen of Scots) in the 1500â€™s or 1600â€™s, where it became a fashionable lap dog and companion for the noble class. King Charles Spaniels were also popular lap warmers (and flea magnets) for the lower class. King Charles II, for whom the breed is named, grew up with a pet King Charles Spaniel (then known as the Toy Spaniel), and was such a big fan of the breed that he was accused of neglecting his official duties to spend time with his pet Spaniels. He once issued a decree that the breed could not be forbidden entry to any building, including Parliament! Some King Charles Spaniels, such as the red and white â€˜Blenheimsâ€™, served as hunting dogs, but most strains were bred for appearance rather than work capacity. Over the years, the breed became smaller with a shorter nose. In the 1920â€™s, a wealthy American man named Roswell Eldrige traveled to England and offered 25 pounds, a large sum at the time, for an â€˜old styleâ€™ or â€˜pointed noseâ€™ version of the breed, similar to Charles IIâ€™s actual dog. The effort was successful, and the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel eventually surpassed its short nosed cousin in popularity, achieving American Kennel Club recognition in 1996.\r\n\r\nSize: The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel has a shoulder height of 30-33 cm (12-13 in) and weighs 5-8 kg (12-18 lbs). It has a large muzzle, large eyes, and long, highly set ears. Cavalier King Charles Spaniels have a flat back and breed-characteristic feathered feet. Unlike most Spaniels, they have a long, feathered tail which is carried high and moves when the dog runs.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel has long, soft, silky hair which is lightly waved. There are four color types which were formerly considered separate breeds: tricolor (â€˜Prince Charlesâ€™), red and white (â€˜Blenheimâ€™), black and tan (â€˜King Charlesâ€™) and red (â€˜Rubyâ€™).

This breed can be either bluish grey or chocolate brown in color. Cesky Terriers carry the fading gene, found in few other breeds, such as the Bearded Collie. The fading gene is a gene that causes the dog"s hair to fade as it grows, much like the graying of people hair as they get older. On blue dogs, the skin is grey and on brown dogs the skin is tan. As the blue dogs get older their fur will turn more grayish, while as the brown terriers will turn a light brown coffee color. The face is a forest of hair, and in some places is curly.

Some even think that Chinese Cresteds (along with the Rhodesian Ridgeback and a few other breeds) are a distinct species from all other dogs! In any case, the Chinese Crested was brought to China in the thirteenth century where it became a popular rat hunter and trading curiosity among sailors. It spread on sailing vessels throughout the mid-East, Africa, and South America. The Chinese Crested was not recognized by the American Kennel Club until 1991. Today, it is a popular show dog with a modest but devoted fan base among pet owners. Chinese Cresteds are sure to catch on in popularity in the coming years.

It may be groomed with a full face of hair, in which case it has the appearance of a Terrier, but more commonly the snout is shaved. All Hairless Chinese Cresteds carry the Powder Puff gene as a recessive trait, as the mix of two Hairless genes is fatal in unborn puppies.

The predominant colors of the Chow are red -- or black. The reds may be light or dark, solid throughout or shaded on the tail and breechings. Less common, the so-called "dilute" colors of cinnamon or fawn (a dilution of red) or blue (a dilution of black) do exist. Occasionally a cream will appear, but usually this specimen has a pink or flesh-colored nose so that it cannot be shown according to the Chow Chow Club"s Breed Standard. Since the cinnamons and blues are somewhat less common than the predominant colors of red or black -- an erroneous idea has spread that the cream, cinnamon, and blue Chows are more difficult to breed and therefore, more valuable. \r\n\r\nSIZE \r\nThe Chow is a medium-size dog generally weighing from forty-five to seventy pounds. The height ranges from seventeen to twenty inches at the withers. Although the Breed Standard does not give any suggested weight, an average-size Chow bitch would generally range from 45 to 55 pounds. An average-size Chow male would generally range from 55 to 70 pounds. No matter what the size or weight, the Chow should be balanced, in that the height of the Chow at the withers should form a square with the length of the Chow"s body; for instance, if the Chow is eighteen inches high from the withers to the ground, he should be eighteen inches long in body. \r\n\r\nPERSONALITY \r\nThe Chow Chow is a highly intelligent dog and values his independence. He can be hugged and played with. He can even be corrected -often by a tone of voice, but he should never be allowed to dominate the household. He is usually amenable to being touched by strangers if he is introduced by one of his owners and approached properly. Quiet, refined, he should not be teased or treated as a lap dog. His dignity and aloofness must never be confused with a fierce or intractable temperament. He minds his own business and does not generally initiate trouble. Bad-tempered Chows are not representative of the breed, but are usually the result of indiscriminate breeding and a woeful lack of "socialization". The Chow"s appearance and personality suggest the nobility of a lion, the drollness of a panda, the appeal of a teddybear, the grace and independence of a cat, and the loyalty and devotion of the dog. The Chow has a little of all these qualities in his appearance and in his behavior. It is, however, his particular intelligence and devotion, his independence and dignity which make him unique. \r\n\r\nCARE \r\nThe Chow needs to be brushed at least twice weekly or more if possible. Grooming is essential to keep the long, thick coat in peak, clean condition. Chows have a dense undercoat that supports the coarser outer coat and gives it its fluffy appearance. Many aduIt Chows have a ruff almost like that of a lion that must be handled with care because it can be stripped away by too much grooming. The puppy undercoat, however should be brushed out when it starts to loosen so that the adult coat may come in properly. Always brush out the dead coat and be careful that the remaining coat does not mat. Both a rake brush and a pin brush (both kinds are available at any pet show and even at most supermarkets) are needed to keep the coat in good, clean condition. The rake is useful in the removal of the fluffy undercoat and the pin brush to groom the longer, off-standing guard hairs which are of coarser quality. Nails should be trimmed regularly to a comfortable length. \r\n\r\nCONFINEMENT \r\nChows should be kept in a fenced-in area or inside the house in a room where they have a good deal of freedom. Chows should not be put on a chain for they resent the feeling of being "trapped". Let your Chow have as much freedom as you have to offer within the limits of his safety and welfare.', 'Chow-Chow.jpg', 'Chow Chow', 'COAT TYPES\r\nThe Chow Chow can have one of two different types of coat; either rough or smooth. The most common coat is the long-haired or rough, which has an outer coat containing long, straight, coarse guard hairs which do not mat or tangle as easily as the soft, thick undercoat. The smooth coated Chow Chow has a short, hard, dense "smooth" outer coat and a definite undercoat. The rough and smooth are two distinct varieties of Chow and although there are many rough coated Chows with fairly shor', 'Chow Chow', 1);

Within a decade, a breed similar to the modern Doberman Pinscher had been created, popularized, and imported to America. In America, it became a popular guard and police dog, and later a well-admired show dog. By the late 1970â€™s, the Doberman Pinscher was the second most popular breed in America. Today, it serves mostly as a pet. Famous Doberman Pinschers include Zeus and Apollo, â€˜the ladsâ€™ from â€˜Magnum, P.I.â€™.

Dobes require a dominant owner to ensure they do not become overly aggressive. They are honorable, fearless, and devoted, making fine companions.\r\n\r\nCare: The Doberman Pinscher must have its claws kept short. The teeth should be brushed regularly and checked periodically for tartar. Remove dead hairs from the Doberman Pinscherâ€™s coat with a knobbed rubber glove during shedding. Dobes are susceptible to Von Willebrand disease (a blood disorder), hip dysplasia, and obesity. They are also sensitive to cold, and should not be left to live outdoors in cold climates.

When the breeds were divided, seven different ones emerged. These breeds include the English Springer, Cocker Spaniel, Clumber Spaniel, Sussex, Welsh Springer, Field and Irish Water. The Springer Spaniel and the Cocker Spaniel were lumped into the same division for a time with only size differentiating the two. This was true until 1892 when they were recognized by the Kennel Club of England recognized them as separate breeds. The English Cocker Spaniel is a gun dog that was utilized for flushing out the prey, driving it towards the hunters and their guns. The name â€œCockerâ€ comes from the Woodcock, a game bird that the English Cocker Spaniel would frequently flush out. Other talents exhibited by the English Cocker Spaniel are retrieving, agility, tracking, watchdog, and competitive obedience. \r\n\r\nSize: The English Cocker Spaniel male will typically reach heights of 15-17 inches tall and an average weight of 28-34 pounds. The female English Cocker Spaniel will typically reach heights of 14-16 inches tall and an average weight of 26-32 pounds.\r\n\r\nCoat:  The coat of the English Cocker Spaniel exhibits medium-length fine hair on the body, and short hairs on the head. The hairs feather around the legs, chest, abdomen and ears, but the hair should not be curly. The coat of the English Cocker Spaniel can come in a wide variety of colors. These colors include solid black, liver, red or parti coloring of white with black, red or liver ticking. If the coat is solid, white markings are only permitted on the chest. It is not uncommon to find tan markings on parti, black or liver colored dogs. \r\n\r\nCharacter: The English Cocker Spaniel is intelligent, lively, gentle, affectionate, and easygoing. They are very loving and prefer not to be left alone for long periods of time. The English Cocker Spaniel will often bond a great deal with one individual within the family. The English Cocker Spaniel is very smart and independent, making them more difficult to train. This breed is not for everyone, as the more timid owner will be overrun by this dogs willfulness. The English Cocker Spaniel will not respond well to harsh discipline, but a firm and consistent pack leader is absolutely necessary. There are two varieties of the English Cocker Spaniel; the field and the show spaniels. The field variety is bred for working ability and will have a higher level of energy. The show variety are bred specifically for conformation shows. Temperaments vary between the field and show lines and are largely dependent on the level of exercise they receive as well as how the dogs are treated by the owner. \r\n\r\nTemperament: The English Cocker Spaniel gets along very well with children, however, as stated previously, this breed tends to bond with an individual rather than an entire family. The English Cocker Spaniel is known to bark, but only does so on an average basis. The English Cocker Spaniel will typically meet new friends easily, but some may be suspicious of strangers if not properly socialized. The English Cocker Spaniel is also known to do well with family pets including cats. Puppies should be well socialized from a young age for best results with other animals. \r\n\r\nCare: Regular grooming with a brush and comb is required for the English Cocker Spaniel, as the coat is prone to tangles. Special attention should be paid to the hair on the legs and ears.

The ears should be cleaned regularly.\r\n\r\nTraining: The English Cocker Spaniel is naturally willing to learn and quickly understands what is expected of it. A great deal of understanding and consistency during training is necessary as it may try to take over your role.\r\n\r\nActivity: Three walks a day are usually enough to keep the English Cocker Spaniel happy, but they also need to have regular opportunities to run freely in the countryside.

Coat colors come in black, tan, and white, for example tri-color (black, white & tan), or bi-color with a white background or any combination of these three.\r\n\r\nTemperament\r\nThe English Foxhound is a courageous, passionate hunter. High energy, they need a lot of daily exercise. They respond well to leadership and are willing and able to be obedient, but are not as responsive as some breeds and training takes patience and a general understanding of the canine animal. They are friendly with people and excellent with children, but prefer to be in the company of other dogs and do well with other animals. The English Foxhound likes to bay. They are untiring, able to run for hours at a consistent speed, for five or six hours without stopping. Can become destructive without enough exercise. The foxhound does slow down somewhat at about seven or eight years old. The English Foxhound is a bit stockier and slower than the American Foxhound, but has similar traits. There are two types, field lines and show lines (bench). Field types are bred for hunting and field trial work. The bench type are bred for conformation shows. Both types are energetic and need daily exercise, but field lines have a higher energy level and need even more exercise. The dominancy level in this breed varies even within the same litter. If you are not the type of person who can display a natural air of calm, but firm authority, then be sure to choose a pup who is more submissive. The temperament of both show and field lines vary widely, depending upon how the owners treat the dog and how much and what type of exercise they provide. Both types are still primarily a pack hunting dog, though they can make good companions if given sufficient exercise. It is recommended that if you are looking to own an English Foxhound solely as a pet, that you are an avid jogger, biker or hiker and are looking for a canine partner. Even show lines will need a great deal of exercise, just a little less, as field types are extremely active.

Putting a backpack on the dog can help them drain their energy quicker. Jogging or biking with the dog running beside you is ideal, as these dogs can go for hours without getting tired.

Those weighing over 11 kg (25 lbs) were classified as Field Spaniels. In the late 1800â€™s, the Field Spaniel was crossed with the Cocker Spaniel and Irish Water Spaniel for an all-black coat, becoming the first Spaniel adapted for the show ring rather than the field. The resulting breed was initially very popular, but further crosses with the Sussex Spaniel and Basset Hound gave the Field Spaniel an overly long and short body shape, leading to a number of health problems and decreased usefulness in the field. This caused the Field Spaniel to plummet in popularity to the point of near extinction. In the 1950â€™s, an effort was made to restore the classic Field Spaniel form through crosses with the English Springer Spaniel. The Field Spaniel was successfully restored to its classic shape, but it remains a very rare breedâ€”most Field Spaniels today descend from that effort and four Field Spaniels named Ronayne Regal, Gormac Teal, Colombina, and Elmbury Morwena.\r\n\r\nSize: The Field Spaniel has a shoulder height of approximately 46 cm (18 in) and weighs 16-23 kg (35-50 lbs). It has a moderate stop (depression where the muzzle meets the forehead), almond-shaped eyes, and low set, wide ears. Field Spaniels have large webbed feet and a tail which slants downward and may be docked.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Field Spaniel has a long, silky coat which is shiny, wavy and somewhat water-resistant. It may be solid colored, bicolor, or roan (close mix of dark and white hairs) in liver, golden liver, mahogany, or black, with possible tan or white markings.\r\n\r\nCharacter: Field Spaniels are gentle, affectionate, and intelligent. Some tend to become attached to one particular member of the family. The Field Spaniel is very adaptable. It is suspicious of strangers and makes a good watchdog, but it not a guard dog. Field Spaniels are happiest when they have a job to do.\r\n\r\nTemperament: The Field Spaniel is friendly to everyone, including children, dogs, and cats. It has a high prey instinct with rabbits, birds, and other small animals unless socialized when young. Field Spaniels are good with children, provided they do not play too roughly.\r\n\r\nCare: The Field Spaniel requires a weekly brushing. Show dogs require a clipping or professional grooming several times a year. Dead hair should be hand-plucked, particularly from the ears and footpads. The Field Spaniel has a lifespan of 12-14 years. It is generally healthy, but susceptible to hip dysplasia (malformed hip joint which can cause lameness or arthritis) and hypothyroidism.\r\n\r\nTraining: The Field Spaniel must be trained with a kind, consistent approach. The Field Spaniel learns quickly and reacts strongly to the sound of its masterâ€™s voice.\r\n\r\nActivity: The Field Spaniel requires daily exercise.

To avoid confusion with the name, both countries simply named the same dog after their own country. Thus exists the Finnish Lapphund and the Swedish Lapphund, varying only slightly in size. The Finnish Lapphund is a medium sized dog that is compact and well built. They are covered with a bushy double coat that can protect against the most severe Finnish weather. Their tails come up over the back and curl, and they can be of any color. Finnish Lapphunds are known to have a distinct marking sometimes appearing around the eyes known as "spectacles". A small circle of fur around the eyes is colored lighter than the rest of the fur, creating the appearance of glasses. They have a foxy-type muzzle, profuse fur and short triangular ears. Finnish Lapphunds are very friendly, weather-resistant and naturally good at alarming their masters, as they bark at unusual occurrences. They have more recently become family pets due to their friendly nature, but were once used for reindeer herding.

The French Bulldog (also â€˜Bouledogue Francaisâ€™ or â€˜Frenchieâ€™) was developed during the Industrial Revolution when workers, primarily lace makers, traveled from Britain to France, bringing smaller Bulldogs with them as companions. Unlike English breeders, French breeders preferred erect â€˜batâ€™ ears and selected for small size and docile temperament. The breed caught on with the upper class, and was brought back to America by wealthy travelers, where it was popularized via spectacular dog shows.\r\n\r\nSize: The French Bulldog has a shoulder height of up to 30 cm (12 in) and weighs 9-13 kg (19-28 lbs). It has a wide head, round ears, and distinctive pointed â€˜bat earsâ€™ with an attentive expression. French Bulldogs have short legs and tails, rounded chests, and compact, muscular bodies. Their unique shape gives them a low center of gravity and an odd stride. The French Bulldog has the appearance of an active, intelligent, muscular dog of heavy bone, smooth coat, compact build, and medium or small structure. Expression is alert, curious, and interested. \r\n\r\nCoat: The French Bulldog has a moderately fine, brilliant coat which is short and smooth.

The French Bulldogâ€™s skin is soft and loose, especially at the head and shoulders, forming wrinkles.\r\n\r\nCharacter: The French Bulldog is affectionate, uncomplicated, gentle, intelligent, sensitive, and fearless. The French Bulldog is known for its loyalty; its happy-go-lucky attitude is in sharp contrast to its sour face. French Bulldogs are happiest by their ownerâ€™s side and will misbehave if ignored. French Bulldogs are active, alert, and playful, but not unduly boisterous.\r\n\r\nTemperament: French Bulldogs enjoy mixing with other dogs and household pets.

Some French Bulldogs are cautious with strangers, but most are friendly to everyone. They are likely to drool or snore. \r\n\r\nCare: When the French Bulldog is shedding, use a rubber brush to remove dead hairs. A special lotion will occasionally need to be applied to the facial and tail folds to keep them clean; soft tooth brushing with an approved toothpaste is also recommended. The French Bulldog has a lifespan of 8-12 years. Due to its facial features, it is susceptible to breathing problems and skin infections, and many are delivered via Caesarean section because of the large head.

Historically, the Swissy was bred as a draft dog to pull heavy carts, as a herding dog to move dairy cattle, and as a watchdog and family companion. The Swiss farmer needed a strong, multi- purpose dog capable of contributing to daily life on the farm.  The Swissy is a very alert, strong and athletic dog who can out power most breeds of dog.   The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is confident in nature and should never be shy and though athletic and very physical, the Swissy is also known to be very gentle with young children.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPEARANCE\r\n\r\nThe Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is a striking, tri-color breed with a short black coat with white and red markings.  White markings should appear on all four paws and tip of tail, as well as on the muzzle, up between the eyes, on the chest and may or may not have white on or around the neck.  Red markings appear on the legs between the black and white, over each eye, on each cheek and under the tail.  They have a large, broad head with a soft, animated expression and dark brown eyes.  They are heavy boned and rather large, with males ranging between 25 Â½ and 28 Â½ inches at the shoulder and females ranging between 23 Â½ and 27 inches at the shoulder.  Though there is no actual standard for weight in the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, males tend to range between 100 and 130 pounds with females ranging between 80 and 110 pounds. Occasionally some Swissys are smaller or larger than these ranges.  While the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog Standard calls for a black, white and red dog, Swissys do come in other colors which include blue, white, and tan tri-color and red and white bi-color. On the blue tri-color dogs, blue replaces where black would normally be and tan replaces where the red would normally be.  On the red bi-color dogs, the dog is solid red with white markings with a total absence of black coloring.  Only black tri-colored Swissys can be shown for Championship titles.  Their flews should be only partially developed, and thus the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog should be dry mouthed.  They should not drool.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERAMENT and PERSONALITY\r\n\r\nThe Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is a happy, jovial breed with an enthusiastic nature and strong affinity to people and children.  They are strongly dependant on people and crave attention and physical contact.   As youngsters, they can be quite boisterous and they do require steady and reliable training to develop manners and physical self-control.   Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs should be very accepting of a non-threatening stranger. Whether that stranger is friendly or neutral, the Swissy should be happy and inviting on approach.  The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog should be confident and comfortable in unfamiliar locations and be stable around strange noises and unfamiliar people.  Swissys should be very accepting of other dogs and species.\r\n\r\nActivity level in the Swissy is very variable.   Swissys are capable of being quite athletic, but typically, that activity is seen in bursts.  Most Swissys are active for short periods of time followed by napping.   However, the Swissy adapts very easily to many different lifestyles. Swissys want to be with their owners and want to participate, and with that desire to be with their people, the activity level of the Swissy most often matches the activity level of the family.\r\n\r\nThe Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is an incredible watchdog.  They tend to notice everything in their surroundings and are very quick to sound alarm.  They will inform you of anything different in their environment, barking at anything that seems out of order.  Faced with a threat, they will stand their ground and put on a show that will intimidate those unfamiliar with the dog.  However, Swissys are not guard dogs.  A Greater Swiss Mountain Dog should be very bite-inhibited.  He should be reluctant to bite, doing so only under the direst of circumstances. \r\n\r\nThe Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is a very dependant dog and one that needs a good leader to follow.    A Greater Swiss Mountain Dog should welcome an authority figure. Given a qualified leader figure, the Swissy has a fairly submissive nature and is a willing worker happy to follow through with the tasks at hand.   The Swissy does not do well in a home environment without a leader.\r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\n\r\nThe Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is capable of pulling carts loaded with 3000 pounds or more, and with this strength, they require training from an early age to respect a leash and must be taught not to pull.   They can be quite physical and boisterous and must be taught to have physical self control so as not to inadvertently injure a person.\r\n\r\nThe Greater Swiss Mountain Dog should be very trainable.  He should be willing and able to learn repeated behaviors.  The Swissy responds very well to encouragement and positive training, yet should also be able to handle a reasonable correction.  The Swissy is a breed that must learn proper manners, and learns best when instructed what to do, as well as what not to do.   While Swissys require socialization to the environment around them, they should not require extensive amounts of socialization to be confident in unfamiliar environments or with unfamiliar people.  They should be naturally confident, willing to try and do new things and meet new people without hesitation.\r\n\r\nSwissys have various degrees of herding instinct, some with very strong drive and others with moderate drive.  Strong herding drive pairs closely with strong prey drive, leading to a desire to chase small animals.  Swissys should be taught from an early age to not chase small animals such as cats, squirrels and small dogs.  Strong herding drive can also lead to games of chase and tackle with small children if not directed and trained properly.\r\n\r\nEXERCISE\r\n\r\nThe Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is a breed that requires a moderate level of exercise.   As a young puppy, extreme exercise should be avoided.  Too much exercise interferes with proper growth of bones and joints, however all puppies need some form of exercise and the lack of exercise can be just as detrimental as too much exercise.  The best rule of thumb is to simply watch the puppy.   The puppy that is up and active needs the exercise and the puppy that just wants to lay down should be allowed to do so.  Care must be taken to avoid over stimulation as Swissys are natural "joiners" who want to be in the thick of attention.   As an adolescent, exercise requirements will increase and increasing the walking schedule will help keep the young, active Swissy under control.  At maturity, they do well with as little as a walk once or twice a day, but can also manage a much more rigorous exercise schedule.   Walking, hiking, back packing, swimming and carting are all good opportunities for exercise to keep a Swissy in good physical condition.

Hundreds of rescue adoption agencies have arisen to provide homes for ex-racers. Famous Greyhounds include Santa"s Little Helper on â€˜The Simpsonsâ€™, who is a rescued race dog. Popular for their athleticism, Greyhounds also serve as the mascot for many sports teams and the logo for Greyhound Bus Lines.\r\n\r\nSize: The Greyhound has a shoulder height of 68-76 cm (26.75-30 in) and weighs 27-34 kg (60-75 lbs). The Greyhound has a long, narrow head with small, folded ears, long hair, and a very deep chest. It has a highly flexible spine, dark eyes, and a long, graceful neck. Its speed comes from its large lungs and heart, powerful muscles, and a special gait in which all its feet leave the ground simultaneously twice per stride.\r\n\r\nCoat: Greyhounds have a smooth, glossy, short-haired coat which requires infrequent grooming and bathing. Greyhounds can come in any color, particularly orange, black, white, fawn, or a roan of these colors with or without white markings.\r\n\r\nCharacter: Greyhounds are calm and sociable. In contrast to their extreme speed when racing or chasing something, they can be so relaxed indoors that some are considered lazy. The Greyhound is intelligent and sensitive, with tremendous stamina. Greyhounds bond very closely with their family.\r\n\r\nTemperament: The Greyhound has a high prey instinct and is inclined to chase anything that moves quickly, so it generally is not a good companion for cats unless raised alongside them. Although cautious around strangers, the Greyhound is normally very good with children and enjoys the company of other dogs. Ex-racers in particular are unlikely to get along with other pets. Greyhounds do not bark often. \r\n\r\nCare: Occasionally grooming the Greyhound with a soft brush is sufficient. Ears should be checked regularly for infection and the claws should be kept trimmed. Greyhounds tend to give chase to anything moving quickly when outside, so keep them on a leash or in an enclosed area. The Greyhound is sensitive to pesticides; flea collars and flea spray are discouraged. Provide soft bedding and a warm living space. Greyhounds have a lifespan of 10-12 years. \r\n\r\nTraining: The Greyhound is fairly easy to train, and is usually obedient unless it has its eyes on potential prey. Greyhounds are sensitive, so an experienced trainer is recommended. They should be challenged by a variety of training exercises.\r\n\r\nActivity: The Greyhound needs to run and walk great distances on a daily basis. A fenced yard of sufficient size is recommended.', 'greyhound2.jpg', 'Greyhound', 'Country of Origin: The Greyhound comes from England, but its roots can be traced all the way back to ancient Egypt, where carvings from 4000 BC are found depicting the dog.

The color should be evenly distributed in patches over the body and in a symmetrical mask over the eyes and ears. The body is square looking and compact. The head is large with a short muzzle and wide set round eyes. \r\n\r\nBreed Characteristics\r\nWhat are the breed characteristics of the Japanese Chin?\r\nThe Japanese Chin is a breed with roots deep in the royalty of both the Chinese and Japanese Courts. You will find that your Chin"s regal ancestry still is apparent as these little dogs often display a noble or haughty air. Chin are basically good natured, sensitive creatures that reflect the atmosphere around them. If your home is full of light and noise, your Chin will most likely be outgoing. If your life tends to be solitary and quiet, your Chin will be likely to be quiet and reserved. \r\nChin are often cat-like in attitude with an ability to climb that is surely unmatched in few other breeds of dogs! Most Chin find their favorite "spot" in the house on the back of the sofa or chair. Also, like cats, Chin tend to groom themselves by licking their paws and rubbing their faces. This has been known to cause the occasional hairball! \r\n\r\nChin often "snizzle" or snort. This is not a sign of a "cold" or other impending illness. The snizzling (blowing hard out of their nose, accompanied by a fine mist) is a result of the animal"s flat face. Chin also reverse sneeze (a honking sound). Although they seem almost unable to breathe, they are not in any distress. If this happens to your pet, many breeders apply gentle pressure on their rib cages or simply stroke their neck. \r\n\r\nA Chin owner should always remember to supply plenty of ventilation and fresh water during warm weather because Chin are very sensitive to heat and humidity. \r\n\r\nGrooming\r\nWhat type of grooming does the Chin require?\r\nThe Japanese Chin is easy to groom. The coat is a single layer, silky and straight and is not prone to matting. Brushing once or twice a week and bathing as needed will keep your Chin sparkling! In addition to shampoo, a creme rinse will provide extra luster and softness. The extra conditioning will also prevent tangles, making your Chin easy to comb. Chin may also be blow dried on a cool setting. While your Chin is shedding (yes, they do shed!), it is a good idea to brush them more frequently. Females seem to shed more than males, but once your female Chin is spayed she will also grow the glamorous coat of a male! Remember to keep your Chin"s toenails clipped and the hair under the feet should be trimmed. No other trimming is necessary. \r\n\r\nLifespan\r\nHow long do Chin live?\r\nThe Japanese Chin has a typical life expectancy of 10-12 years with some living 15 years or more. \r\n\r\nWheezing\r\nWhy does my Chin snort or wheeze?\r\nChin do what is referred to as a "reverse sneeze" because of their short faces - the soft palate may be comparatively long enough to temporarily block the airway. The wheeze is usually not cause for concern, and will stop when the Chin swallows, equalizing pressure on either side of the palate. (This is somewhat akin to swallowing during an airplane"s ascent to equalize pressure on either side of the eardrum.) If a wheezing episode lasts for more than a few minutes, a veterinarian should be consulted. \r\n\r\nTraining\r\nWhat type of training do I need to know for the Japanese Chin?\r\nTo make your Chin a well-behaved member of your community, the JCCA highly recommends early socialization of your puppy. Many all-breed kennel clubs, community centers, and veterinarians offer puppy kindergarten classes as well as many levels of obedience training. We encourage all Chin owners to train their pets to be the best canine citizens they can!', 'japanese chin.jpg', 'Japanese Chin', 'General Appearance\r\nWhat is the correct appearance of the Japanese Chin?\r\nThe Japanese Chin is a dainty and stylish dog that is usually between 8 to 11 inches tall and can be as small as four pounds or as much as fifteen pounds.

The name â€˜Komondorâ€™ means â€˜of the Cumanâ€™ indicating the Komondorâ€™s origin with the nomadic Cuman tribe which settled in Hungary in the 1100â€™s. Another theory is that the Komondor, like the Puli, which shares its remarkable curls, came to Hungary with the Magyar tribe. The Komondor may be related to the large white South Russian Ovtcharka. It served to protect sheep herds from predators, particularly wolves. By some tales, the Komondor was such a skilled fighter that the Hungarian wolf went nearly extinct once it came to prominence. The Komondor was imported to America in 1933 and recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1937. Many European Komondors were killed during World War II, probably because they courageously defended their homesteads. Due to the Komondorâ€™s high grooming requirements, it is still fairly rare outside its native Hungary, though in recent years quite a few have been employed as flock guardians in the Western United States, a trend spurred by the rise in coyote population.\r\n\r\nSize: The Komondor has a shoulder height of at least 65 cm (25.5 in) and weighs 32-36 kg (70-80 lbs); some weigh as much as 57 kg (125 lbs). The Komondor has a wide skull and muzzle, almond-shaped eyes, and triangular ears. Komondors have a tail carried low and large feet.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Komondorâ€™s long, white, thick, naturally corded coat is its defining feature. The coat begins cording at one to two years of age. The coat protects the Komondor from cold weather, but it is not well suited to wet weather. The thick coat provides protection from attacking predators and allows the Komondor to blend in naturally to a sheep herd when necessary. The Komondor sheds little to no fur.\r\n\r\nCharacter: The Komondor is confident, protective and loyal. It is calm and friendly until its family or home is threatened, then it will fight to the death to protect them without hesitation. Komondors can be somewhat stubborn and independent, but make a great family companion if properly socialized and trained.\r\n\r\nTemperament: The Komondor is somewhat territorial and can be reserved with strangers, but it will accept them once it understands they present no danger. The Komondor should be socialized when young so it does not grow averse to new people and pets. If socialized, it will actually enjoy the company of another dog. The Komondor is good with older children but should be supervised around young children as it may bite if it is harassed.\r\n\r\nCare: The Komondorâ€˜s coat must have its cords regularly separated by hand to remove dirt. It must be bathed occasionally to prevent fleas or ticks from collecting in the large coat. When wet, the Komondor takes hours or even days to dry off. The Komondor can be clipped but this removes a lot of the breedâ€™s distinct appeal. The Komondor has a lifespan of 10-12 years. Common health problems include hip dysplasia (malformed hip joint which can cause lameness or arthritis), eye problems such as cataracts or entropion (curled eyelid which can scratch the cornea), and bloat, a potentially serious health problem which can be prevented by feeding from a raised dish, spreading meals throughout the day, and avoiding exercising your Komondor immediately after meals. \r\n\r\nTraining: The Komondor requires firm, consistent training at an early age because it will be very large, strong, and fast when fully grown. Obedience training is strongly recommended. A praise-based approach with plenty of variety will likely yield the best results.\r\n\r\nActivity: The Komondor requires daily exercise such as a walk or playtime in the yard.

This color is controversial and some claim it is a Weimaraner cross, while others say it is a true mutation. The head of the labrador is broad with a moderate stop. The nose is thick, black on black and yellow dogs and brown on chocolate dogs. The nose color often fades and is not considered a fault in the show ring. The teeth should meet in a scissors or level bite. The muzzle is fairly wide. The neck is proportionately wide and powerful. The body is slightly longer than tall.

The first written evidence of the Maltese comes from the third century B.C. Over the centuries this breed has been known by many names, including the â€˜Shock Dogâ€™, â€˜Maltese Lion Dogâ€™, â€˜Spaniel Gentleâ€™, â€˜Comforter Dogâ€™, â€˜Roman Ladiesâ€™ Dogâ€™, and my personal favorite, â€˜Ye Ancient Dogge of Maltaâ€™. The name â€˜Malteseâ€™ was only assigned in the 20th century. The breedâ€™s origins are unknown; it may descend from Spitz or an Asian breed such as the Tibetan Terrier. Maltese may have been used to hunt rodents before their royal appearance became paramount. In any case, the small, white Maltese remained isolated on the island of Malta for centuries and hence stayed true to breed. Eventually, they were exported throughout Europe and became popular with the upper class, purportedly including Mary, Queen of Scotts, Josephine Bonaparte, and Marie Antoinette. The Maltese was first imported to America in the 1870â€™s and recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1888. Today it is a popular show dog. Publius, Roman governor of Malta in the early first century A.D, had a Maltese named Issa who was immortalized by poet Marcus Valerius Martialis: â€˜Issa is more frolicsome than Catulla"s sparrow, Issa is purer than a dove"s kiss. Issa is gentler than a maiden. Issa is more precious than Indian gems...Lest the last days that she sees light should snatch her from him forever, Publius has had her picture painted.â€™\r\n\r\nSize: The Maltese has a shoulder height of 20-25 cm (8-10 in). Maltese have a domed skull, round dark eyes surrounded by a dark â€˜haloâ€™, wide, black, nose, and low ears covered by long hair. Some have a â€˜winter noseâ€™ which fades to pink in the winter; the color change can be permanent in older dogs. The Maltese carries its tail over the back and to one side and has small, round feet.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Maltese has a distinctive long, white, silky coat with no undercoat. Some standards allow cream or lemon colored ears. The Maltese does not shed and is a good match for those with allergies.\r\n\r\nCharacter: The Maltese is eager to learn, fearless, friendly, and sociable. Its high energy level may overwhelm new owners who arenâ€™t prepared for it. Maltese are not prone to excessive barking, but their tendency to bark at suspicious activity makes them excellent watchdogs. They love to cuddle, but are not overly demanding of attention. \r\n\r\nTemperament: Maltese easily befriend other dogs and cats, even much larger ones. Maltese puppies may be too playful for small infants. Maltese will bark at strangers but grow used to them quickly.\r\n\r\nCare: The Maltese requires quite a bit of grooming, from daily brushing and combing to special lotions to remove tear stains (careful brushing with a warm metal comb works as well). Dead hair should be brushed out, as the Maltese does not shed. Irritating hairs around the eyes need to be removed. Some pet Maltese are trimmed in a â€˜puppy cutâ€™ of 1 to 2 inches in length over the entire body for easier maintenance. Some show dogs are â€˜wrappedâ€™ to prevent matting of the fur. The Maltese has a lifespan of 12-14 years, though some live as long as 18 years. Most are healthy, but some are prone to heart issues such as prolapsed valve syndrome and enlarged ventricle, which usually present around the 10th year and can be controlled with medication. Many Maltese have dental issues. They can begin losing teeth by the age of 8 if not properly cleaned. Maltese are prone to sunburns where their hair parts. They get cold easily in chilly climates but can also become quickly overheated as they do not easily dissipate heat.\r\n\r\nTraining: Encouragement rather than harsh words should always be used when training the Maltese. They are very sensitive. Maltese are very difficult to housebreak and may need to be paper or box trained.\r\n\r\nActivity: The Maltese does not require a great amount of exercise. It can have its needs met by indoor play and activities, and enjoys playing chase.

The Manchester Terrier likes to please its handler and learns quite quickly. These dogs can be outstanding in activities like agility skills and catch and also do well in obedience trials. They thrive on attention from their owners, and need leadership from their humans. Without enough exercise, mental stimulation, and or, if the dog is allowed to be pack leader to the humans, they can get upset when left alone. Becoming bored, hyper, destructive, and bark excessively when alone and ignored.  Pack leaders are allowed to leave the followers, however, followers are not allowed to leave the pack leaders. They very much do enjoy being with their people, and should be taken for a pack walk before they are left for long periods of time to put them in an instinctual rest mode. The Manchester Terrier should be thoroughly socialized when it is young, and be around humans who display leadership towards the dog, along with rules, boundaries and limitations for the dog to follow, to prevent potential aggression. This breed needs thorough, firm training. A lack of human leadership can result in them becoming demanding, headstrong, protective, snappish, and/or aggressive. Manchester Terriers should not be trusted with other small non-canine animals, as the hunting instinct in them is strong. They should be introduced to children as a young pup and children should be taught how to display leadership towards the dog. Well balanced Manchester Terriers who have owners which do not let them develop small dog syndrome, human induced behaviors, where the dog is believes he is pack leader to humans, will not display these negative behaviors.

The â€˜Bullâ€™ in â€˜Bull Terrierâ€™ derives from the popular practice of â€˜bull-baitingâ€™, in which several dogs were matched up against a chained bull. The Bull Terrier was later bred with the Spanish Pointer to increase its size, resulting in a highly successful, powerful, persistent fighter. After dog fighting was abolished, Bull Terriers were bred with the Dalmatian to produce a white colored strain, then again with the Staffordshire Bull Terrier to reintroduce color. Both the white and colored types increased in popularity as pets, and both strains remain today. Famous Bull Terriers include the Target mascot â€˜Bullseyeâ€™, Spuds MacKenzie, who was used in Bud Light commercials (and later discovered to secretly be a female!), and Patsy Ann, a Bull Terrier from Juneau, Alaska famous for unfailingly predicting the impending arrival of ships to port.

Miniature Bull Terriers have small, deeply set eyes, positioned near the middle. Their ears are small, triangular, and erect. They have short, powerful backs, flat tails and small, round â€˜cat feetâ€™.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Miniature Bull Terrier has a dense, short-haired coat. It can be all white (with possible markings on the head), or a solid color with highlights. Acceptable colors are solid black or a mix of tan with either white, red, broken black, or fawn. Miniature Bull Terriers are average shedders, shedding twice a year.\r\n\r\nCharacter: Miniature Bull Terriers are happy, comical, and playful, but they are also very stubborn and strong-willed when the mood strikes them.

Provided proper social training has taken place, it can make friends with cats or other household pets. The Miniature Bull Terrier may try to dominate other dogs depending on its individual nature and upbringing. It may be an unwise purchase for those who already own a dog. Miniature Bull Terriers should not be encouraged to participate in rough play, and may be too hyper to play with young children. They may become destructive when left alone or unexercised.\r\n\r\nCare: The Miniature Bull Terrierâ€™s coat should be brushed periodically with a rubber brush to remove dead hairs.

Standard Schnauzers (or â€˜Mittelschnauzersâ€™) became popular in World War I by serving as messengers and police dogs, and increased in popularity as a pet after World War II. The Miniature Schnauzer (or â€˜Zwergschnauzerâ€™) was bred in the late 1880â€™s as a ratter by crossing the Standard Schnauzer with the Affenpinscher and probably the Poodle. The Miniature Schnauzer was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1933. It is the only Schnauzer classified as a Terrier, and the only Terrier that does not descend from the British Isles.

They also get along with other dogs more easily, though they may bark a lot.\r\n\r\nCare: The Miniature Schnauzer requires weekly combing and biannual grooming/shaping. Typically, pet Schnauzers are clipped and show dogs are stripped (dead hair is plucked via a serrated knife edge). Excessive hair around the pads of the feet should be removed and the ears must be kept clean. Miniature Schnauzers with cropped ears should be checked for ear infections.

The Neapolitan Mastiffâ€™s ancient origins are with the Molossians, an early Hellenic tribe known for its powerful guard dogs. In 326 B.C., King Porus of Punjab gave Alexander the Great a pair of Neapolitan Mastiffs which proved quite popular. These dogs were bred widely, producing many offspring which were adapted by the Romans as war dogs and fighters. They were also pit in the Arena against gladiators, bears, and even elephants. The dogs were later crossed with fierce British guard dogs, producing an even larger, more powerful breed resembling the modern Neapolitan Mastiff. It was discovered near Naples in 1946 by Piere Scanziani, who standardized the breed and promoted its development. Few Neapolitan Mastiffs arrived in America until the 1970â€™s. They were fully recognized by the American Kennel Club in 2004. Neapolitan Mastiffs have inspired portrayals in fictional literature including â€˜Fangâ€™ from â€˜Harry Potterâ€™ and â€˜Pansyâ€™ from Andrew Vachssâ€™ series of Burke detective novels.\r\n\r\nSize: The Neapolitan Mastiff has a shoulder height of 60-75 cm (23-30 in) and weighs 50-70 kg (110-150 lbs). It has a large, droopy, wrinkled head with large flews (upper lips) and dewlap (wrinkled folds beneath the chin), deep set eyes which are almost entirely covered by folds, and pronounced stop (depression where the muzzle meets the forehead). Loose folds of skin cover nearly the entire body. Neapolitan Mastiffs have a flat back, round feet, and low-hanging tail docked to two-thirds its natural length.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Neapolitan Mastiff has a short, dense, hard, fine, uniformly smooth coat. The Neapolitan Mastiff can be standard grey, leaden grey, dove-grey, leaden black, brown, fawn, deep fawn, light fawn, or hazel. White patches on the chest and tips of the toes are not uncommon. \r\n\r\nCharacter: The Neapolitan Mastiff is confident, gentle-natured, and powerful. Bred as a guard dog, it is highly suspicious of strangers and protective of its property and family. It does not bark unless necessary. Neapolitan Mastiffs are intelligent, majestic, and noble. They do drool and tend to make a mess when eating and drinking.\r\n\r\nTemperament: Neapolitan Mastiffs are very good with children if socialized early, but close supervision around young children is advised due to their massive size. The Neapolitan Mastiff generally gets along with other dogs and household pets, but socialization when young is recommended. Male Neapolitan Mastiffs may be aggressive with other male dogs.\r\n\r\nCare: The Neapolitan Mastiff requires frequent cleaning of the dewlap area and facial folds. Other than that, the Neapolitan Mastiff coat requires little attention; dead and loose hairs should be removed with a rubber brush when the Neapolitan Mastiff is shedding. As with all very large dogs, the Neapolitan Mastiff needs a soft place to lie down to avoid pressure marks. The Neapolitan Mastiff has a short lifespan of 8-10 years, with larger dogs tending toward the lower end of that range. Common health problems for Neapolitan Mastiffs include hip and elbow dysplasia (malformed joints which can cause lameness or arthritis), skin infections, and cardiomyopathy.

The name Norwegian Elkhound translates to â€œNorsk Elghundâ€ which literally means Norwegian moose dog. The breed is also referred to as the Norsk Elghund Gra and Norsk Elghund Sort. The Norwegian Elkhound was utilized by the vikings to hunt both small and large game. It was not uncommon for a Norwegian Elkhound to hunt large game such as elk, mountain lion and bear as well as small game such as badger or rabbit. This is a very versatile hunter that will hold its prey at bay, barking until the hunter has arrived to claim his prize. The Norwegian Elkhound is also regarded as an excellent sled dog. Also, the Norwegian government has given their Defense Minister the power to mobilize all privately owned Norwegian Elkhound during times of war. In more recent years, the Norwegian Elkhound has gained popularity in private homes as a family companion. The American Kennel Club first recognized the Norwegian Elkhound in 1913. \r\n\r\nSize: The Norwegian Elkhound male will typically reach heights of 19-21 inches tall and an average weight of 50-60 pounds. The female Norwegian Elkhound will typically reach heights of 18-20 inches tall and an average weight of 40-55 pounds.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Norwegian Elkhound"s coat is made to endure the fiercest cold weather conditions. The heavy double coat feels thick and hard to the touch. The coat is gray with black at the tips and a lighter colored undercoat. The ears, muzzle and tip of the tail are black. Norwegian Elkhound puppies are born with an entirely black coat that will develop into the standard coat at around a week old. \r\n\r\nCharacter: The Norwegian Elkhound is a very intelligent, friendly and loyal breed. They will bond easily with family, but will be inseparable from their leader. This breed is quite sensitive and their feelings are easily hurt if they feel deserted. The Norwegian Elkhound is a very willful breed that will require extra attention in obedience training. The Norwegian Elkhound is very smart and has the ability to learn commands quickly, but may choose not to follow them if there is something more interesting going on. It is up to the owner to make the dog understand the importance of their commands. A Norwegian Elkhound without enough exercise can become very high strung and even destructive, so it is imperative that plenty of physical as well as mental exercise be provied.\r\n\r\nTemperament: The Norwegian Elkhound is an alert, affectionate and protective breed whose distinct bark makes them an excellent watch dog. The Norwegian Elkhound will be reserved and suspicious around strangers, but will greet known family friends with enthusiasm. This breed is known to get along well with children, but it is imperative that the dog understand the child(ren) out rank him. The Norwegian Elkhound is a hunting breed and so is not recommended for homes with small pets such as hamsters, rabbits or gerbils. Much socialization from a young age would be required to ensure the Norwegian Elkhound understands that the small pets out rank him in the pack. The Norwegian Elkhound is also known to be aggressive towards other dogs and should be well socialized in an attempt to prevent that. \r\n\r\nCare: The Norwegian Elkhound"s coat requires a good deal of grooming, but the upkeep is simple. The coat should be brushed on a regular basis, with emphasis on the time of year when the Norwegian Elkhound sheds his undercoat. A rubber brush or a comb with double rows of metal teeth should be used to remove the dead hair that clings to the new hair. Excessive bathing will remove the natural oils of the Norwegian Elkhound"s skin, so baths should only be given when necessary. This breed is a heavy shedder on a seasonal basis, however, there"s none of that pesky dog smell from this arctic breed.\r\n\r\nTraining: The Norwegian Elkhound, while very intelligent, is also very independent. This breed will learn commands with ease, however, they may not always follow them. It is necessary to be a very firm and consistent pack leader with this breed to ensure they know who"s boss. Rules must be laid out for the Norwegian Elkhound and followed rigorously to ensure the dog does not develop bad behavior. It is necessary to make it clear to this dog that they do not out rank any member of the family. \r\n\r\nActivity: The Norwegian Elkhound would do okay in an apartment if given sufficient exercise. The breed is relatively active indoors and will be happiest if provided a yard to play in.

Norwich greets everyone as a long lost friend, and the more attention he can draw out in return the better. Originally bred in England to control rodents, Norwich terriers retained the inborn curiosity and reflexes of hunters. They notice everything in their environment but at the same time they are the most easy-going among terriers. They get along with children, with other dogs and cats, but given their hunting origin they might not be the best buddies with pet rodents.\r\n\r\nGrooming\r\nThe seemingly easy, wash-and-go appearance of Norwich Terrier is deceiving in regards to the grooming needs. The coat requires a special grooming technique referred to as â€œstrippingâ€, a process of pulling out entire hairs by experienced terrier groomers. Pigment in Norwich Terrierâ€™s fur is distributed along the very end of each hair. Cutting the hair means cutting off the pigmented portion of hair, therefore dogs that have not been properly groomed and had their coat cut instead of â€œstrippedâ€, lose the depth of color and texture. A red dog becomes wheaten, while a black and tan dog appears silvery. A Norwich coat properly maintained by an experienced terrier groomer has wiry texture that does not attract much dirt. Along with its waterproof qualities, a correctly â€œstrippedâ€ Norwich fur does not require frequent bathing.\r\n\r\nHealth Concerns\r\nAlthough a hardy breed, with relatively few health problems, Norwich Terriers are prone to Upper Airway Syndrome (UAS). The condition varies from very mild, where the dog might be reluctant to exercise in hot weather, to severe where the dogâ€™s quality of life is seriously compromised. UAS means an anatomical obstruction in the airway. It most often involves elongated soft palate and everted laryngeal saccules. A surgical correction is usually very successful, but limiting the dogâ€™s exposure to hot temperatures and keeping him fit and in good weight might be all that is needed. Responsible breeders carefully select the parents to ensure that Norwich terrier puppies have the best chances to not develop UAS.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nForever seeking their ownersâ€™ attention, Norwich terriers learn fast.

They are average shedders and do not matt or tangle. \r\n\r\nHEALTH\r\nSometimes prone to problems with the kneecaps (patella) in the hind legs, this can sometimes be corrected by surgery. Also fontanel (an opening at the top of the skull similar to a baby human"s "soft spot"). It sometimes corrects itself but if it does not, the dog needs to be protected. Some have a difficult time under anesthesia. \r\n\r\nEXERCISE\r\nPapillon need a daily walk. Play will take care of a lot of their exercise needs, however, as with all breeds, play will not fulfill their primal instinct to walk. Dogs who do not get to go on daily walks are more likely to display behavior problems. They will also enjoy a good romp in a safe open area off lead, such as a large fenced in yard. \r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\nPapillons can be trained to perform small tricks.

The Pekingese has changed little in over 2000 years. It was bred by Lamaist Buddhist monks who believed lions embodied the essence of Buddha and sought to create a lion-like dog. Pekingese became companions for royalty, permitted to breed only in the Imperial Palace. During the Tâ€™ang Dynasty (700-1000 A.D.) Pekingese were even considered to be royalty themselves, with personal servants at their disposal. Pekingese came to the west in 1860 when the British raided the Forbidden City and seized five Pekingese belonging to the Emperorâ€™s Aunt, which were sent as a gift to Queen Victoria and other British royalty. They were highly popular back in England, gradually increasing in number and growing in popularity through modern day. In the early 20th century, the Chinese Empress Dowager Cixi presented a small black Pekingese named â€˜Manchuâ€™ to President Theodore Rooseveltâ€™s daughter Alice. Other famous Pekingese include romance novelist Barbara Cartlandâ€™s white dog â€˜Pekeâ€™ and â€˜Sun Yat Senâ€™, pet of Henry Harper from Harper Brothers Publishing, who, along with his owner, survived the Titanic disaster!\r\n\r\nSize: The Pekingese has a shoulder height of 15-23 cm (6-9 in) and weighs 3-6 kg (7-14 lbs). It has a very large, flat skull, flat muzzle, large eyes, nose located between the eyes, distinctive â€˜Vâ€™-shaped wrinkle above the nose, heart-shaped ears and undershot bite. The Pekingese has a huge puffy tail carried over the back and large front feet turn slightly outwards. Its legs are bowed, supposedly to discourage wandering, but this dog can keep up a fast pace when necessary. The Pekingeseâ€™s bowed legs give it a unique and entertaining gait.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Pekingese has long, abundant hair. A variety of colors are possible, the most common being gold, red and sable. Other possible Pekingese colors are black and beige, white, black, cream, or blue. In the words of Chinese Empress Dowager Cixi â€˜For its color, let it be that of the lion - a golden sable, to be carried in the sleeve of a yellow robe; or the color of a red bear, or a black and white bear, or striped like a dragon, so that there may be dogs appropriate to every costume in the Imperial wardrobe.â€™\r\n\r\nCharacter: The Pekingese is affectionate and noble, but not particularly fond of strangers. It has a stubborn, independent reputation. However, once it bonds with its owner, it is wholly devoted. Pekingese tend to bond most strongly with one person. As Chinese Empress Dowager Cixi said, â€˜Let it be lively that it may afford entertainment by its gambols; let it be timid that it may not involve itself in danger; let it be domestic in its habits that it may live in amity with the other beastsâ€¦ Let it comport itself with dignity; let it learn to bite the foreign devils instantlyâ€¦ Sharks fins and curlew livers and the beasts of quails, on these may it be fedâ€¦For the days of sicknessâ€¦give it to drink a throstle"s eggshell full of the juice of the custard apple in which has been dissolved three pinches of shredded rhinoceros horn.â€™ No wonder this breed is a little self absorbed! However, one thing the Empress did not mention is that Pekingese tend to snore.\r\n\r\nTemperament: If socialized properly, the Pekingese can get along with other dogs and pets, but it is naturally suspicious. The Pekingese does not like to be disturbed and will not tolerate disrespect, so it is probably not well-suited for homes with small children. \r\n\r\nCare: The Pekingese requires a great deal of maintenance, including daily brushing, particularly on the belly and between the legs, and grooming every few months or when dirty. Powdering or dry shampooing is also required. Excessive hair around the pads of the feet must be trimmed. The Pekingese has a lifespan of 13 to 15 years. The most common issue is congestive heart failure, which does not usually surface until at least six years of age and can be treated successfully with prescription medications if diagnosed early. Other potential health issues for the Pekingese are breathing difficulties, eye problems (particularly eye ulcers), and skin rashes.\r\n\r\nTraining: A Pekingese considers itself to be its own boss (if not the king of the house), but it can be trained through positive reinforcement. Patience is required when training the Pekingese.\r\n\r\nActivity: The Pekingese has very little need for exercise, making it especially suited for life in an apartment. The Pekingese enjoys a leisurely stroll outside, but is highly prone to heat exposure and should never be left outside or over exercised in hot weather.', 'pekingese.jpg', 'Pekingese', 'Country of Origin: The Pekingese (also known as the â€˜Lion Dogâ€™, â€˜Foo Dogâ€™, â€˜Fu Dogâ€™, â€˜Peking Palasthundâ€™, and of course â€˜&#23470;&#24311;&#29509;&#23376;&#29399;â€™) is an ancient breed from China of unknown ancestry, though by Buddhist legend it was created from the mating of a lion with a butterfly, monkey, or marmoset. â€˜Pekingâ€™ is an old transliteration of Beijing, the capital city of China.

They have become closely associated with the British monarchy. They were highly popular in the 20th century among royalty.

The Corgi is an intelligent and remarkably alert breed who is wary of strangers and makes a very good watchdog. Although known for their bark being worse than their bite, they do have a tendency to nip at the heels of people and this trait should be discouraged at a young age in order to remove it. The Pembroke requires companionship and without this may develop undesirable methods of seeking attention. Differences between the Pembroke and the Cardigan: The Pembroke has straighter legs; is not quite as long bodied; the head is generally more wedged-shaped; the ears are smaller and closer together; they are usually lighter; and they do not have a tail or as bushy a tail as the Cardigan. They are often born without a tail at all. They can often appear sprightly in character and are quite confident.

The Pointer was bred from the Foxhound, Bloodhound, Greyhound, and Bull Terrier. By the 1700â€™s it had become popular for locating birds and silently pointing toward them until the hunter was ready to shoot (which could take a while with the firearms available at the time). Pointers were popular with the noble class for sport hunting on estates; often two Pointers were used, which allowed the hunter to locate birds more quickly and accurately by following both dogsâ€™ line of sight. The Westminster Kennel Club, which organizes what is widely considered to be Americaâ€™s most prestigious dog show, was formed in 1877 primarily to breed and display Pointers. A Pointer named â€˜Sensationâ€™ is its well known emblem. Today, Pointers are popular hunting dogs for bobwhite quail, pheasant, and woodcock, particularly in the American South, where they are sometimes called simply â€˜bird dogsâ€™. Pointers are also popular field competitors, but not common pets. Judy, a Pointer who served aboard a Royal Navy vessel during World War II, was known for pointing out approaching Japanese planes before the crew had observed their approach. After the ship was sunk and the crew became POWâ€™s, Judy assisted in smuggling the crew food and assisting where possible. After her death in 1950, Judy was awarded the â€˜animalâ€™ Victorian Cross, which is on display in Londonâ€™s Imperial War Museum.\r\n\r\nSize: The Pointer has a shoulder height of 58-71 cm (23-28 in) and weighs 20-34 kg (45-75 lbs). It has a long head, deep muzzle, pronounced stop (depression where the muzzle meets the forehead), and soft, thin ears. Pointers have a straight, tapered tail carried flat and breed characteristic oval feet. They have a compact, alert appearance.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Pointer has a short, dense coat. Possible colors are liver, lemon, black, or orange; Pointers can be solid colored or white with colored speckles (â€˜tickingâ€™) or larger markings. Dark colored Pointers have black or brown noses and light colored Pointers have light colored noses.\r\n\r\nCharacter: Pointers are gentle, sweet and kind. They are single-minded on the trail, but calm indoors if sufficiently exercised, enjoying downtime on the couch as much as the rest of the family. Pointers are very loyal and loving with their owners.\r\n\r\nTemperament: The Pointer gets along very well with other dogs and shows no aggression towards cats or other household pets. Pointers are great with children, but puppies may a bit too boisterous for small children. Pointers do not mind strangers, but their large size and deep bark may frighten those who are not comfortable with them. \r\n\r\nCare: The Pointer requires only an occasional quick brushing with a soft brush to remove dead hair and minimize shedding. It has a lifespan of 12-16 years. Pointers are generally healthy, but subject to common canine ailments such as hip dysplasia (malformed hip joint which can cause lameness or arthritis), epilepsy, and food allergies.

In other words, just about anything but pink with blue stripes. The male Pomeranian sheds once a year and the female sheds when in heat or after giving birth.\r\n\r\nCharacter: The Pomeranian is an energetic, intelligent dog which is eager to learn and very loyal to its family. It is active and confident. Pomeranians bark at suspicious activity and can be trained to make excellent watchdogs. They enjoy cuddling up for a nap or running around like crazy, sometimes both in the same minute.\r\n\r\nTemperament: The Pomeranian gets along well with other dogs and household pets, especially if socialized at a young age. However, it does not tolerate mistreatment and will not enjoy too much attention from young children, as rough play may cause it to grow frustrated and bite. Pomeranians are suspicious of strangers, but will grow used to them when they understand that no danger is presented.\r\n\r\nCare: The Pomeranian should be brushed several times a week and bathed only as necessary. Proper dental hygiene is also important; a weekly tooth brushing is required at a minimum, but daily brushing is optimal. The Pomeranian has a lifespan of 12-16 years, though some live as long as 20 years. Common health problems are luxating patella (dislocated knee), patent ductus arteriosus (a heart defect), and collapsed trachea. The Pomeranian may â€˜reverse sneezeâ€™, which is a fit of gasping and snorting to remove fluid caught under the palate. This is not dangerous, but may frighten the Pomeranian and its owner; it should be handled by talking to the Pomeranian calmly and gently rubbing its throat. \r\n\r\nTraining: The intelligence of the Pomeranian makes training fairly easy. Pomeranians must be trained when young not to bark excessively. Pomeranians should also be trained not to linger at their ownerâ€™s feet, for risk of being stepped on and injured.\r\n\r\nActivity: Indoor games, short walks, and playtime in the yard are sufficient activity to keep a Pomeranian happy.

The name likely derives from the German word for â€˜Poodleâ€™. When the Magyar migrated to Hungary, their sheepdogs bred with indigenous species, possibly including the Tibetan spaniel. The resulting breed was an adept sheepherder, known to herd sheep by jumping on them; black was preferred to quickly distinguish the dog from surrounding sheep. The Puli was bred with western European breeds after the invasion of Hungary in the 1500â€™s, leading to changes in its appearance which led to the near extinction of the original breed. In the early 1900â€™s, a breeder named Emil Raitsits led a successful effort to restore the breed (though no one is quite sure what the ancient breed looked like). The Puli was first standardized in 1925 and was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1934. Today, the Puli is a popular herder but not as popular as a show dog or pet.\r\n\r\nSize: The Puli has a shoulder height of 41-43 cm (16-17 in) and weighs 11-16 kg (25-35 lbs). It has a domed skull with almond-shaped eyes and â€˜Vâ€™-shaped ears. The Puli is muscular with a flat back, round feet, and tail carried over and blending into the back.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Puliâ€™s long, naturally corded coat, which reaches to the ground, is its defining feature. It is caused by the Puliâ€™s soft undercoat meshing with its rough outer coat. The coat begins cording at about six months of age. The Puliâ€™s curls are similar to dreadlocks, making it almost waterproof. The Puli can be black, cream, gray, or white. Some cream colored Pulik (â€˜Pulikâ€™ is the plural noun) have a black mask. Pulik do not shed.\r\n\r\nCharacter: The Puli is happy, friendly, and smart, making an excellent pet. The Puli is suspicious of strangers and is an excellent watchdog. It may bark a lot.\r\n\r\nTemperament: The Puli is friendly with children, dogs and other pets if socialized from a young age. Young children must be taught to respect the Puli and should be supervised around it; if harassed, the Puli may bite.\r\n\r\nCare: The Puliâ€™s coat can be brushed out or left naturally corded. Brushed coats must be brushed every day or two; corded coats need to be frequently separated by hand to remove dirt. The corded Puli should be bathed regularly to prevent fleas or ticks from collecting in the large coat. When wet, the Puli takes hours or even days to dry off. The Puli can be clipped, but this removes a lot of its unique appeal. The Puliâ€™s eyes and ears should be cleaned regularly. The Puli lives 12 years or longer. It is a healthy breed with no known major health conditions, though it may be susceptible to conditions which commonly afflict large breeds, such as eye problems and hip dysplasia (malformed hip joint which can cause lameness or arthritis).\r\n\r\nTraining: The Puli is an intelligent breed which trains well, but it has a stubborn streak so a firm, consistent approach is required. \r\n\r\nActivity: The Puli is an active, energetic breed which requires daily exercise.

European settlers of Rhodesia in the 1700â€™s found a domesticated dog with such a ridge among the native Khoisan tribe. They adapted the Rhodesian Ridgeback to the purpose of hunting lions and other large game, probably by crossing it with large breeds that came with them such as the Bloodhound, Greyhound, and Great Dane. The resulting breed could run at great speeds, withstand harsh weather conditions, and hunt by sight or scent. Groups of two Rhodesian Ridgebacks were sent out to corner, taunt, and confuse a lion while the hunter stepped in for the kill. The first breed standard for the Rhodesian Ridgeback, based on the Dalmatian, was drawn up in 1924, and American Kennel Club recognition followed in 1955. Today, the Rhodesian Ridgeback is a popular show dog, companion, and hunter.\r\n\r\nSize: The Rhodesian Ridgeback has a shoulder height of 61-69 cm (24-28 in) and weighs 32-36 kg (70-85 lbs). It has round eyes, a flat, broad skull, highly set ears, and pronounced stop (point at which the muzzle meets the forehead). Rhodesian Ridgebacks have small feet and a strong tail which is slightly curved upwards. They should have a black nose and dark eyes or liver nose and amber eyes.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Rhodesian Ridgeback has a short, thick, glossy coat of light or red wheaten (pale yellow-brown) with a dark mask. Some standards permit white markings. The Rhodesian Ridgebackâ€™s distinguishing feature is the ridge running along its spine composed of hair pointing in the opposition direction of the rest of its coat.\r\n\r\nCharacter: The Rhodesian Ridgeback is loyal, intelligent and straightforward. Rhodesian Ridgebacks are independent, brave, and cautious around strangers. The Rhodesian Ridgeback is highly territorial and can be aggressive if not properly trained.\r\n\r\nTemperament: The Rhodesian Ridgeback should be socialized with cats and other dogs when young to prevent later problems. Rhodesian Ridgebacks are kind with children but will not tolerate mistreatment, so they should be supervised around young children. \r\n\r\nCare: The Rhodesian Ridgeback should be brushed periodically to remove dead hairs, more often when shedding. The Rhodesian Ridgeback has a lifespan of 9-11 years, though some live up to 15. Like other large breeds, it is susceptible to elbow and hip dysplasia. Other potential problems for Rhodesian Ridgebacks are cataracts, cancer, and Dermoid sinus, a fatal skin condition associated with the â€˜Ridgeâ€™ which should be screened for by your breeder.\r\n\r\nTraining: The Rhodesian Ridgeback is somewhat stubborn, so a consistent approach to training is required.

Famous fictional Rottweilers include the puppet Triumph the Insult Comic Dog from The Conan O" Brien Show and the family pet in Ferris Bueller"s Day Off.\r\n\r\nSize: The Rottweiler is 56-69 cm (22-27 in) in shoulder height and weighs 38-59 kg (85-130 lbs). Rottweilers have a broad head with triangular ears, and a docked tail leaving several tail vertebrae. Rotties are built for strength and endurance; their bite force was measured by "National Geographic" to be the strongest among all breeds tested.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Rottweiler has a distinct short, thick, coarse outer coat, with a thick under layer. It must always be black with brown markings. Occasionally there are long-haired Rottweilers, or Rotties with a white chest marking, but these traits are considered undesirable.\r\n\r\nCharacter: The Rottweiler is brave, loyal, obedient, protective, watchful, and strong. It will risk life and limb to defend its family. Rottweilers are powerful and usually serious, requiring frequent attention. Rotties are often silent, observant, and serene, but females may bark more often than males.\r\n\r\nTemperament: If properly socialized, a Rottweiler makes a good playmate for children and gets along well with cats and other household animals.

The ears must be kept clean, and the claws must be kept short. The Rottweiler enjoys cold or cool weather, but shelter must be provided. Rotties need frequent socialization. They tend to overeat and snore, so sharing a doghouse will probably be out of the question. Rotties live 10-12 years and may have large litters of 12 or more puppies.\r\n\r\nTraining: The dominant nature of the Rottweiler makes it necessary that its trainer is calm, consistent, firm, and fair. Rottweilers are eager to learn, and obedience training is an absolute requirement. The Rottweiler is very intelligent and can excel at a variety of sports in addition to its capacity as a guard dog and watch dog.\r\n\r\nActivity: The Rottweiler requires daily exercise. Take it with you to run in the open country or the woods, as it does not wish to wander far from its family. Rotties also love to swim, run beside a bicycle, or catch a ball. Over exercising a Rottweiler is just about impossible, so have at it!', '220px-Rottweiler3.jpg', 'Rottweiler', 'Country of Origin: The Rottweiler (affectionately called "Rottie") originates in the Roman Empire, where it was used to herd cattle. The name derives from the small town of Rottweil, Germany. The Rottweiler nearly went extinct in the 1800"s, but today it has come back in popularity and is used as a police dog, guard dog, herd dog, and tracker. It is a very strong, courageous, seemingly invulnerable breed. Famous fictional Rottweilers include the puppet Triumph the Insult Comic Dog from The Conan', 'Rottweiler', 1);

As long as the weight stays in proportion with the height, the taller the dog the more prized. This breed has been used as an avalanche and rescue dog in the snowy passes near the Hospice. This amazing servant of mankind has saved more than 2,000 people. It has a highly developed sense of smell and also seems to have a sixth sense about impending danger from storms and avalanches (perhaps it may hear very low frequency sounds that are beyond our ability to hear). There are two varieties: short-haired and long-haired; the short-haired variety is more often used for mountain work because it can tolerate cold temperatures while the long-haired variety"s coat tends to collect icicles. This dog can find a person even under many feet of snow. Some of this breed"s talents are: search & rescue, watchdogging and carting. \r\n\r\nTEMPERAMENT\r\nThis breed is extremely gentle and friendly. It is very tolerant of children. It is slow moving, obedient, and patient. It is eager to please and extremely loyal to its family. Since this dog is so large, be sure to socialize it very well at a young age with people and other dogs. Training should be gentle and start at an early age while the dog is still a manageable size. Keep in mind that an unruly dog of this size presents a problem for even a strong adult if it is to be exercised in public areas on a leash, so take control from the onset. The Saint Bernard makes a good watchdog; even its size is a good deterrent. This breed tends to drool after drinking or eating. It has an excellent sense of smell. \r\n\r\nGROOMING\r\nVery dense, water-resistant, tough, without feeling rough to the touch. There are two types of coat: rough, and smooth. Both types of coats are easy to groom. Comb and brush with a firm bristle brush, and bathe only when necessary. This breed sheds twice a year. \r\n\r\nHEALTH\r\nHip dysplasia, albinism, bone problems, heart defects, and a short life span. Epilepsy, skin allergies, laryngeal paralysis, temperament problems and osteosarcoma, a bone cancer which has been shown to be hereditary in this breed, are also health concerns. Finally, bloat is a threat to this breed due to their deep chests. Bloat is a health concern to most dogs, being the second largest killer of dogs. It is also known as gastric torsion or twisted stomach. \r\n\r\nEXERCISE\r\nDaily short, regular walks are better than long sessions. Apartments should not be considered. A house with a large backyard is preferred. Saint Bernards need people in their life, and should not be left alone for long periods of time. They have a tendency to suffer from separation anxiety. An owner should be a patient, confident leader who prefers a lazy, friendly, slow-thinking pet that always wants to be with them. The best owner for this breed would be someone living in a rural or suburban home where neatness is not a major concern. This breed requires quite a lot of space. \r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\nTraining: Saint Bernards must receive obedience training as a puppy because of their tremendous size as an adult. They must be trained to not pull on a leash when young. They should also be socialized as young as possible in order to ensure a good temperament. Learning Rate: High. Obedience - Medium.

It was a perfect working dog for the harsh Siberian conditions: hardy, able to integrate into small packs, and quite happy to work for hours on end.

The first evidence of its existence comes from a painted portrait of a Smooth Fox Terrier in 1790. By some theories, the Smooth Fox Terrier and the Wire Fox Terrier are variations of the same breed (they were interbred until the 1980â€™s); the other possibility is that the Smooth Fox Terrier descends from the Smooth Black and Tan Terrier, Beagle, and Bull Terrier while the Wire Fox Terrier descends from the Rough Black and Tan Terrier. The Smooth Fox Terrier was a popular breed for fox bolting (chasing foxes out into the open where they could be attacked by larger dogs); white was preferred to distinguish the dogs from foxes at night. The Smooth Fox Terrier was one of the earliest show dogs, recognized as a single breed along with the Wire Fox Terrier in 1885 by the American Kennel Club and accepted as a distinct breed a century later. Many popular Terrier breeds descend from the Smooth Fox Terrier. Famous Smooth Fox Terriers include Skip from the book â€˜My Dog Skipâ€™ (apocryphally portrayed by a Jack Russell Terrier in the film), and Sir Aurel Steinâ€™s six Smooth Fox Terrier companions, all named Dash, who accompanied him on his spectacular adventures across the globe from 1896 to 1950.\r\n\r\nSize: The Smooth Fox Terrier has a shoulder height of 33-41 cm (13-16 in) and weighs 7-8 kg (15-19 lbs).

Smooth Fox Terriers have muscular, well-proportioned bodies with a highly set, mostly straight tail and small, round feet.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Smooth Fox Terrier has a short, smooth, hard and dense coat. The coat is predominantly white with possible black and/or tan markings. Smooth Fox Terriers have a solid or half-and-half colored face with possible markings or blaze, or color on the eyes and/or ears only. The Smooth Fox Terrier sheds a considerable amount (substantially more than the Wire Fox Terrier). \r\n\r\nCharacter: The Smooth Fox Terrier is very loyal and affectionate. It is playful, energetic and exuberant, with an abundance of courage. Smooth Fox Terriers make excellent pets, but if ignored or unexercised they will bark, dig, chew furniture, and stage escape attempts.\r\n\r\nTemperament: The Smooth Fox Terrier needs to be socialized well as a puppy. It tends to pick fights with other dogs. Although playful with children, Smooth Fox Terriers need to be watched as they can bite. They like to explore and bark occasionally.\r\n\r\nCare: The Smooth Fox Terrier should be brushed weekly with a firm bristled brush and bathed when necessary. Smooth Fox Terriers have a lifespan of 12-15 years.

It may have arrived in Asia with the armies of Attila the Hun or Genghis Khan. The Tibetan Mastiff is an influential breed, thought to be an ancestor of the Saint Bernard, Newfoundland, Pug, and others. Its original function was as a guardian for sheep flocks, monasteries, and entire villages. Marco Polo met some Tibetan Mastiffs on his trips throughout Asia, describing them as â€˜tall as a donkey with a voice as powerful as that of a lion.â€™ The Tibetan Mastiff was unknown outside of Tibet until 1847, when Queen Victoria received one as a gift from the Viceroy of India. Tibetan Mastiffs became endangered in their native country in 1959 when China invaded Tibet. Two Tibetan Mastiffs were delivered to President Eisenhower by the Dalai Lama as a preservation effort, but they did not successfully produce any breeding lines. Larger numbers of Tibetan Mastiffs were finally imported to the U.S. and Europe from India and Nepal in the 1970â€™s. The Tibetan Mastiff was accepted under the American Kennel Clubâ€™s Miscellaneous category in 2005. It is still somewhat rare, but breeders are successfully increasing the Tibetan Mastiffâ€™s number through selective crossbreeding of international stock.\r\n\r\nSize: The Tibetan Mastiff normally has a shoulder height of 61-66 cm (24-26 in) and weighs 45-72 kg (100-160 lbs), though a few stand up to 80 cm (31 in) and weigh as much as 110 kg (242 lbs). The Tibetan Mastiff has a large, wide head with pronounced stop (depression where the muzzle meets the forehead), deep set eyes, and high set â€˜Vâ€™-shaped ears. Tibetan Mastiffs have a flat back, stomach tucked up behind the chest, long tail curled over the back, and large, round feet.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Tibetan Mastiff has a long, thick coat with a heavy under layer. Tibetan Mastiffs can be black, golden brown, or grey. They may have tan markings and/or white on the chest or feet. Some Tibetan Mastiffs have longer hair on the head and neck, giving the appearance of a mane. In China, this variety is referred to as the â€˜Lion Headâ€™ Tibetan Mastiff, with the shorter haired variety being known as the â€˜Tiger Headâ€™ Tibetan Mastiff. The Tibetan Mastiff sheds only once a year, making it a good breed for allergy sufferers. \r\n\r\nCharacter: The Tibetan Mastiff is dignified, self-confident, loyal, and calm. It tends to be stubborn and dominant, befitting its origins as a guard dog. The few remaining individuals from Tibet are particularly aggressive, whereas Western-bred dogs are generally more obedient. Tibetan Mastiffs make excellent watchdogs and protectors, but tend to bark frequently.\r\n\r\nTemperament: The Tibetan Mastiff is reserved around strangers. It loves children it knows, but unknown children may be considered a threat against children of the family. Provided proper socialization has taken place, the Tibetan Mastiff gets along well with other dogs and household pets.\r\n\r\nCare: The Tibetan Mastiff requires grooming with a brush, especially on the hindquarters and tail. Brushing should occur weekly, or daily when shedding. The Tibetan Mastiff has a fairly long lifespan for a large breed at 10-14 years. It is a healthy breed, especially given the limited breeding pool, but susceptible to common canine health problems such as hip and elbow dysplasia (malformed joints which can cause lameness or arthritis), ear infections, skin allergies, and eye problems such as PRA and entropion/ectropion (curled eyelid which can scratch the cornea).\r\n\r\nTraining: The Tibetan Mastiff must be trained in an atmosphere of mutual respect, as it will ignore a handler who uses strong words and shows a willingness to strike. Obedience classes when young are highly recommended.\r\n\r\nActivity: The Tibetan Mastiff has an average need for exercise, but tends to grow destructive if cooped up indoors all day. For this reason, Tibetan Mastiff ownership is discouraged for small apartments. Tibetan Mastiffs enjoy going to the countryside, but are not interested in playing fetch or games with a ball.

The Fox Terrier was one of the earliest show dogs, recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1885 (the Smooth Fox Terrier and Wire Fox Terrier were recognized as distinct breeds a century later). Toy Fox Terriers were bred from their larger cousins by American farmers who favored the shorter variety for chasing rodents. Toy Fox Terriers were crossed with other breeds such as the Chihuahua and Manchester Terrier for a smaller size and slightly calmer temperament. The Toy Fox Terrier was recognized as a distinct breed by the American Kennel Club in 2000.\r\n\r\nSize: The Toy Fox Terrier has a shoulder height of 20-28 cm (8.5 to 11 in) and weighs 1.5-3 kg (3.5-7 lbs).

It was used by the Magyar tribe of the Carpathian Basin for rat hunting as far back as 800 A.D, and later adapted for pointing, retrieving, and tracking. The first written record of the Vizsla appears in the â€˜Illustrated Viennaâ€™ chronicle, prepared on order of King Louis the Great in 1357. Vizslas faced near extinction in the 1800â€™s, falling in popularity to the English pointer. The Vizsla is an ancestor of the Weimaraner and German Shorthaired Pointer, and these breeds may have been later crossed back into the Vizsla. The rare Wirehaired Vizsla (only a few hundred exist in North America) was developed by crossing the Vizsla with the German Wirehaired Pointer and Griffon in the 1930â€™s for a dog with heavier coat for hunting in cold weather. A Vizsla named Sari was the first Vizsla imported to the United States, in 1950. The Vizsla was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1960 and is today a popular show dog, hunter, and pet.\r\n\r\nSize: The smooth haired Vizsla has a shoulder height of 52-61 cm (20-24 in). The wirehaired Vizsla is slightly taller at 54-62 cm (21-24 in). Vizslas weigh 18-29 kg (40-65 lbs). They have long, low set ears, eye color fitting with the coat color, white teeth, and moderate stop (depression where the muzzle meets the forehead). The Vizsla has a tail which is usually docked at two thirds the natural length (three quarters in wirehaired) and small, round â€˜cat feetâ€™. It is a medium sized, muscular, lean dog.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Vizsla varies from golden rust to dark gold to red. Small white markings on the chest and feet are permissible. The smooth haired Vizsla has a short, abundant coat. The rare wirehaired Vizsla has a close, dense, wiry, coat 2-3 cm (.75-1.25 in) in length, with a water-repellant undercoat. \r\n\r\nCharacter: The Vizsla is affectionate and intelligent. It is known for its loyalty. Vizslas are very energetic and will become destructive if ignored or not sufficiently exercised.\r\n\r\nTemperament: The Vizsla is very gentle and gets along well with children, other dogs, and any household pets. It will bark at strangers.\r\n\r\nCare: The smooth haired Vizsla requires very little grooming; it should be brushed periodically to remove dead hairs and bathed a few times a year. The wirehaired Vizsla must be plucked periodically. The Vizsla has a life expectancy of 10-14 years. Though not unhealthy, the limited number of Vizsla available for breeding leads to a few potential health problems, such as epilepsy, hip dysplasia (malformed hip joint which can cause lameness or arthritis), digestive problems (including possible food allergies), and eyelid problems such as ectropion and entropion. The smooth haired Vizsla is not tolerant of cold and should not live outdoors.\r\n\r\nTraining: The Vizsla is not difficult to train because it is happy to learn and eager to please, though it can be stubborn. Consistency is important. Vizslas are sensitive and should be trained gently; harsh training methods are likely to backfire.\r\n\r\nActivity: The Vizsla is an energetic breed which requires a substantial amount of exercise, including playtime in a large yard, long walks or jogs, and most especially hunting.

It was bred from Continental pointing breeds, Bloodhounds, and mastiffs in an intentional effort to produce a noble looking, all-purpose gundog which could hunt prey of all sizes. The origins of the Weimaranerâ€™s distinctive grey color are unknown, but it has been present for centuries. The Weimaraner is named for the Grand Duke of Weimer, whose court sponsored its breeding. Ownership of the Weimaraner was carefully restricted for decades; only members of the upper class German Weimaraner Club were allowed to own the breed. For this reason, most dogs were kept indoors and pampered, leading to a strong attachment to the family which continues to this day. A pair of Weimaraners was finally released to America in 1929, and the Weimaraner quickly became a popular hunter and show dog, achieving American Kennel Club recognition in 1943. Famous Weimaraners include Dwight D. Eisenhowerâ€™s dog Heidi, and Man Ray and Fay Ray, photographer William Wegmanâ€™s pets and photography subjects.\r\n\r\nSize: The Weimaraner has a shoulder height of 58-69 cm (23-27 in) and weighs 25-41 kg (55-90 lbs). The Weimaraner has a grey nose, grey or amber eyes, and long, highly-set ears. Weimaraners have a sloped back and webbed feet. Most have a tail docked to a third of its natural length. The Weimaraner has an athletic and regal appearance. \r\n\r\nCoat: The Weimaraner has a short, hard coat which is smooth to the touch. There is a long, silky haired variety with an undocked tail which is recognized by some standards, but not in North America. The Weimaraner is a distinctive gray color which can range from silver to mouse-colored (beige or tan toned). The skin is flesh-toned rather than white or black.\r\n\r\nCharacter: The Weimaraner is loyal, playful, friendly, eager to work, intelligent, and energetic. It is sometimes called the â€˜dog with a human brainâ€™ because of its high problem solving abilities. Weimaraners are rambunctious and driven, particularly when young, and require a firm and patient owner. They have a very high requirement for socialization and can be fairly described as â€˜emotionally needyâ€™. If unexercised or ignored, Weimaraners will attempt to chew everything in sight.\r\n\r\nTemperament: Provided proper socialization has taken place as a puppy, the Weimaraner gets along fine with other dogs and household pets. The Weimaraner is friendly toward children, but due to its high energy level it is generally not recommended for homes with young children. The Weimaraner is not friendly towards strangers; it is highly territorial and will protect its family in times of danger.\r\n\r\nCare: The short-haired Weimaraner has few grooming needs. Periodically use a rubber brush to remove dead hairs. The long-haired variety needs to be brushed and combed regularly. Its ears must be checked for cleanliness to prevent infection.\r\n\r\nTraining: Behavioral training is strongly recommended for the Weimaraner; some suffer from separation anxiety or aggressive behavior (as a natural hunter, all Weimaraners will maintain some degree of aggression). The Weimaraner is eager to please its handler and learns quickly. A confident approach is required as this breed sometimes tries to dominate. Weimaraners excel in a variety of dog sports such as agility competitions.\r\n\r\nActivity: The Weimaraner needs daily strenuous exercise such as a long jog or play in a yard; it has a seemingly endless supply of stamina.

Xolos are named after the god of Aztec mythology Xolotl (â€˜itzcuintliâ€™ just means â€˜dogâ€™), who, according to legend, created them from a sliver of the bone from which all human life was made. He instructed mankind to care for and protect the dog as it would lead departed human souls from the underworld to Heaven. The Aztec apparently didnâ€™t take this to prohibit eating the Xoloitzcuintliâ€™s meat, as many did so for religious or (supposed) medicinal purposes; in fact, this practice continues today in some areas of Mexico. The Xoloitzcuintli was recognized by the American Kennel club in the 19th century, but recognition was stripped as the breed had nearly gone extinct by the 1950â€™s. Aggressive breeding programs rescued the Xoloitzcuintli, and foundation stock has now been accepted by the AKC with recognition expected to be forthcoming.\r\n\r\nSize: The Xoloitzcuintli comes in a wide variety of sizes.

It was carefully bred from a number of working terriers, some of which came to England alongside Scottish immigrants looking for factory work. The Yorkshire Terrier may have derived its long coat and blue coloring from the Clydesdale and Skye Terriers, and its signature coat pattern likely results from crosses with the English Black and Tan Terrier. Early Yorkshire Terriers were known as Broken-Haired Scotch Terriers or Toy Terriers. Huddersfield Ben, born in Yorkshire in 1865, was a popular champion and skilled ratter who sired many small Yorkshire Terriers and is today universally recognized as the patriarch of the breed. The Yorkshire Terrier was imported to America in 1872 and recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1878. The Yorkshire Terrier became the American Kennel Clubâ€™s second most registered dog in 2006 at 48,000 registrations, beat out only by the Labrador Retriever. Famous Yorkshire Terriers include Audrey Hepburnâ€™s Yorkie â€˜Mr. Famousâ€™ who appeared with her in â€˜Funny Faceâ€™ and Tricia Nixonâ€™s pet Yorkie â€˜Pashaâ€™. â€˜Totoâ€™ from â€˜The Wizard of Ozâ€™ was played by a Cairn Terrier in the film but originally illustrated as a Yorkshire Terrier in the novel. Some Yorkies are famous for their small size, such as Big Boss, Guinness World Record holder in 2002 for smallest living dog at 12 cm (5 in) tall, and Sylvia, a Yorkshire Terrier from England who was the smallest dog in recorded history at 2.5 inches tall and weighed merely 4 ounces!\r\n\r\nSize: The Yorkshire Terrier is 20-23 cm (8-9 in) tall and weighs 2-3 kg (4-7 lbs). Yorkshire Terriers have a small, flat head, level or scissors bite, dark, intelligent eyes, and small, highly set, â€˜Vâ€™-shaped ears. They have a flat back, round ears, and tail carried high.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Yorkshire Terrier has a very long, straight, silky coat which is golden-brown at the head, chest, and legs. The color and texture of the coat are perhaps the most important show trait. Puppy Yorkshire Terriers are born black and tan and gradually attain their natural color. Show dogs are groomed with the hair grown out long (sometimes trimmed to floor-length) and parted down the middle of the back. Yorkies have no undercoat and shed little.\r\n\r\nCharacter: Yorkshire Terriers become attached to their families, but most maintain some measure of independence. They have a boisterous Terrier personality that far exceeds their small size. Yorkies are lively, bold, and intelligent (scoring in the top third in dog intelligence tests). They bark when they sense danger. Due to their strong â€˜alpha-dogâ€™ personality, the Yorkshire Terrier may not be suitable for inexperienced owners.\r\n\r\nTemperament: The Yorkshire Terrier is tolerant of older children, provided they respect its personal space. Due to its small size and bold temperament (which arises from its working origins) the Yorkshire Terrier is not recommended for young children unless carefully supervised. The Yorkshire Terrier can occasionally be a bit too brave when dealing with larger dogs, but gets along fine with cats and other household pets. Yorkies prefer life indoors, and are especially unsuited to cold climates.\r\n\r\nCare: The Yorkshire Terrier requires intensive brushing and combing on a daily basis. If this is too time-consuming, the coat should be trimmed professionally. The Yorkieâ€™s hair should be kept out of its eyes by a rubber band or a bow. Loose hairs should be regularly removed from ear passages. Yorkshire Terriers have a lifespan of 12-15 years. Yorkie puppies are prone to hypoglycemia (diagnosed by listless behavior and shakiness) and adults are prone to a number of musculoskeletal issues and distichia (extra eyelashes on the eyelid which can scratch the cornea if not properly treated). Yorkies under 3 pounds are especially susceptible to diarrhea, vomiting, tracheal collapse, anesthesia sensitivity, and injury.\r\n\r\nTraining: The Yorkshire Terrier is intelligent and capable of learning quickly with consistent training, but some prolong the process with their independent, stubborn nature. The Yorkshire Terrier is considered to be one of the more difficult breeds to housebreak.\r\n\r\nActivity: The Yorkshire Terrier can have most of its needs met through indoor play, but still prefers a daily walk or romp in a fenced-in yard.

What began as an "Oops" moment (Spurlin observed the result of an accidental breeding between an Alaskan Husky and an unknown small breed dog) resulted in inspiring Spurlin to pursue a new breed. Several breeds were used in creating this breed, including both the Siberian and Alaskan Huskies, the Schipperke and the American Eskimo Dog. However, the Alaskan Klee Kai has been breeding true since 1988. The original name for this breed was simply Klee Kai, however, politics took hold and the breed split into Alaskan Klee Kai and Klee Kai in 1995 for political reasons. The Alaskan Klee Kai is also known as the AKK, Miniature Alaskan Husky and Mini Husky. The Alaskan Klee Kai breed was created to provide a smaller companion version of the Alaskan Husky. They are currently recognised by the UKC, ARBA, CKC, NKC, APRI, ACR and the DRA. \r\n\r\nSize: The Alaskan Klee Kai can come in 3 different sizes; Toy, Miniature and Standard. They can weigh anywhere from under 10 lbs to 23 lbs depending on whether they are Toy, Miniature or Standard breeds. Their height will range from under 13 inches for Toy to 17.5 inches for Standard and can fall anywhere in between.\r\n\r\nCoat: &#65279;The Alaskan Klee Kai has a double coat and is sufficient in length to give a well furred experience. However, should the coat distort the outline of the dog, it is considered a breed fault. Accepted colors for the Alaskan Klee Kaiâ€™s coat are black and white, gray and white, or the more rare red/cinnamon and white. It is possible to come across a solid white Alaskan Klee Kai, however, this is a show disqualification and a white Alaskan Klee Kai is not eligible for registration. The Alaskan Klee Kai blows its coat twice a year, however, when it isn"t blowing its coat, the Klee Kai does not require much grooming.\r\n\r\nCharacter: The Alaskan Klee Kai tend to be a little "dog aggressive" if not socialized properly. It is truly wise to begin socialization as soon as you get your Alaskan Klee Kai. The Alaskan Klee Kai is not recommended for living situations with small animals such as birds, rabbits or gerbils unless they are raised with them. This is due to the strong prey drive that is present in this breed. If they are not socialized well with small animals from a young age, they will have the propensity to hunt and kill them. They are also not recommended for homes with small children. They do not take well to the typical antics of babies and toddlers, such as pinching, poking and pulling and may respond by nipping at the child. \r\n\r\nTemperament: &#65279;The Alaskan Klee Kai is a part of itâ€™s pack. They require a good amount of face time with their owners and would prefer to follow them wherever they go. However, the AKK is cautious and will not immediately warm up to strangers or unfamiliar situations. They do have wonderful watchdog potential, as they are extremely loyal and alert as well as prone to barking. The Alaskan Klee Kai can become a high strung dog without the right level of activity.\r\n\r\nCare: &#65279;The Alaskan Klee Kai is an average shedder and should be brushed on a regular basis. They also should receive baths only when necessary. They are relatively easy to care for. One nice thing to note about the Alaskan Klee Kai is that it is not typical for it to have doggy odor or bad breath. So feel free to get close to your puppy and give it lots of love. The Alaskan Klee Kai has very few genetic defects to speak of. Some of the few health concerns associated with this breed are: Juvenile Cataracts, Liver Disease, Extreme Shyness, Factor VII Deficiency, Pyometra, Luxating Patella, Cryptorchids and Cardiac Issues Including PDA. Also, this breed is relatively young and other health issues could still arise. \r\n\r\nTraining: &#65279;The Alaskan Klee Kai is an intelligent breed and is a fairly quick learner. The AKK requires a firm and consistent pack leader during training and would benefit greatly from obedience school. The breed has the propensity to develop â€œsmall dog syndrome", so it is imperative that the dog knows who"s boss. \r\n\r\nActivity: &#65279;The Alaskan Klee Kai is not a breed for those who live a sedentary lifestyle.

Others believe the Australian Kelpie descends from black Australian Collies bred with the Australian dingo. By the latter theory, owners of pet dingoes registered them as Australian Kelpies because dingo ownership was illegal, later crossing their dingoes with genuine Australian Kelpies. Some physical similarities and breeding records lend credence to this theory. In either case, the Australian Kelpie in its modern form began in Australia in the 1860â€™s, when â€˜Kingâ€™s Kelpieâ€™ was bred widely after winning a major herding competition. The Australian Kelpie is an adept herding dog, able to work with sheep, cattle, and poultry. The Australian Kelpie is not currently recognized by the American Kennel Club because it is more of a working dog then a show dog.

Their very short fur almost always features white markings as this breed was selectively bred to include this attribute. The Azawakh breed has tails that hang down with a small curl at the end and a practically hairless belly. They were originally used in Mali for hunting and protection as they are often wary with strangers and even aggressive. However, these dogs will be affectionate and gentle to those they know and are even playful with owners. With protective instincts and an alert nature, the Azawakh dogs will gather together with their pack and chase away danger if they feel threatened. This breed makes an excellent guard and watch dog thanks to their intelligence, light-footed build and caution toward strangers. \r\n\r\nTEMPERAMENT\r\nOwners of Azawakhs love the breed! These dogs make exceptional guard dogs but remain gentle and affectionate toward their family. They are playful and friendly with people they know. On the other hand, they will be suspicious and have been known to show aggression toward strangers. Combined with their natural intelligence and protective instincts, this makes them alert watch dogs.

But despite its formidable appearance, the Bergamasco is really a trim, athletic sheepdog. \r\n\r\nGeneral Appearance\r\nThe Bergamasco is a muscular, heavy-boned herding dog with a large head and a thick tail that hangs down to the hock and curves slightly upward at the end. The entire dog is covered with an abundant coat that forms mats. The Bergamasco is compact in profile but is just slightly longer than tall. \r\nThe Bergamasco"s characteristic feature is its unique coat, made up of three types of hair.

Poodle crossbreeds are meant to produce a dog with mixed traits and the Poodleâ€™s signature nonshedding coat. As a crossbreed, the Bich Poo is not eligible for registration with purebred registries such as the American Kennel Club, but it can be registered with the American Canine Hybrid Club, as â€˜Poochonâ€™. The Bich Poo is not considered a purebred because it doesnâ€™t â€˜breed trueâ€™, meaning that it doesnâ€™t display a consistent set of characteristics. Like other â€˜designer breedsâ€™, the Bich Poo has seen a recent surge in popularity. Some breeders produce Bich Poos by crossing a purebred Poodle with a purebred Bichon Frise (called a first generation cross), but others allow crossing Bich Poos with Poodles or Bichon Frises (called a backcross), or other Bich Poos (called a multi-generation cross). Different crosses can result in different characteristics. \r\n\r\nSize: The Bich Poo varies in size and appearance, depending on its parents and whether it is bred from a Standard, Miniature, or Toy Poodle. On average, Bich Poos weigh 6-15 lbs (3-7 kg).\r\n\r\nCoat: The Bich Poo has a soft, curly coat. Most Bich Poos have little dander and do not shed, making them a good match for those with allergies. Owing to its Poodle heritage, the Bich Poo comes in a wide variety of solid or mixed colors. White and apricot are most common; other colors include gray, black, and chocolate. The Poochon may be groomed like a Poodle or with a fluffy Bichon style, or given a shorter, low maintenance â€˜puppy cutâ€™.\r\n\r\nCharacter: The Bich Poo is sensitive, responsive, and affectionate. Bich Poos love to play and have a seemingly endless supply of energy, though they are not as hyper as some breeds and are happy to curl up on the couch for a nap. On the other hand, Bich Poos may have sudden spikes of energy which cause them to run wildly around the house, like the Bichon Frise. The Bich Poo is very intelligent and clever; it has a habit of entertaining its owner with clever tricks. Bich Poos make good watchdogs. \r\n\r\nTemperament: The Bich Poo is friendly toward strangers, children and other dogs. Bich Poos are great companions for kids, but should be supervised around young children to prevent them from teasing the dog or playing rough. Since the Poochon is a hybrid, it may exhibit characteristics of both the Bichon Frise and the Poodle. \r\n\r\nCare: The Bich Poo must be brushed regularly and groomed every two to four months, depending on grooming style. Bathe only as necessary. The Bich Poo has a lifespan of 12-15 years. The Bich Poo may be susceptible to health problems affecting the parent breeds, such as allergies and eye cataracts, but as a mixed breed it is somewhat less likely to suffer health problems than purebreds (known as â€˜hybrid vigorâ€™).\r\n\r\nTraining: The Bich Poo is intelligent and therefore easily trained. The Bich Poo can learn a variety of tricks and behaviors very quickly.

The Blackmouth Cur should be evaluated as a working dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog"s ability to work. Scars should neither be penalized nor regarded as proof of a dog"s working abilities. \r\n\r\nCharacteristics \r\n\r\nThe Black Mouth Cur is a fast, hard hunter that finds game using its eyes, ears and nose. Silent trailers are preferred, although slightly semi-open on a very hot track is allowed. Never open like a hound. A loud, deep chop on bay or tree, ringing cry or slight yodel allowed.

It is named after the Italian city â€˜Bolognaâ€™, and sometimes called the â€˜Bichon Bologneseâ€™. The Bolognese became a popular pet among royalty in Spain when Cosimo the Elder, an influential political leader from Florence, Italy, brought several with him as gifts during his visits in the 1400â€™s. Over the next few centuries, the Bolognese increased in popularity throughout Europe, appearing prominently in paintings by artists Francisco Goya and Tiziano Vecelli. However, its numbers dropped off dramatically in the following years. Recently Italian breeder Gian Franco Giannelli has led an effort to revitalize the Bolognese, but it remains a rare breed with less than 1,000 estimated Bolognese in the United States. The Bolognese is not yet recognized with the American Kennel Club, but is registered with its Foundation Stock Service. It made its first appearance at Crufts, the worldâ€™s largest international dog show, in 2002. PLEASE NOTE: This breed has been accepted for recording in the AKC Foundation Stock Service (FSS). This is simply an avenue to maintain reputable records regarding the breedâ€™s development. This breed is not eligible for AKC (American Kennel Club) registration. \r\n\r\nSize: The Bolognese has a shoulder height of 25-30 cm (10-12 in) and weighs 2-4 kg (5-9 lbs).

The Bolognese is a small, squarish dog which is about as tall as it is wide.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Bolognese has a very distinctive coat. It is a large mass of long, straight, fluffy locks which covers the entire body, slightly shorter on the face. The Bolognese has a woolly, not silky, texture, and is never clipped or cut. There is no undercoat. Bolognese are pure white without any markings or shadings. The Bolognese is hypoallergenic.\r\n\r\nCharacter: The Bolognese is cheerful, intelligent, focused and obedient. It is highly attached to its owners, following them from room to room. The Bolognese does not bark frequently, but will raise the alarm at potential dangers, making a good watchdog. It is playful and affectionate, bonding closely with its owners. The Bolognese is less energetic than the Bichon Frise. It makes an excellent companion.\r\n\r\nTemperament: The Bolognese enjoys the company of other dogs, pets, and children. Young children should be supervised around the Bolognese (as with all small breeds) for its protection. As it enjoys being with its family, the Bolognese should not be left alone often. It is reserved, but not aggressive, with strangers.\r\n\r\nCare: The Bolognese should be combed out daily as its coat tangles easily. Monthly grooming is recommended; the Bolognese should not be clipped or trimmed. The Bolognese has a lifespan of 12-14 years and an average litter of 3 puppies. It has no known major health problems.\r\n\r\nTraining: The Bolognese is eager to please and usually easy to train.

The height of the Cavachon will largely depend on the size of the parents. A Cavachon can appear tall as well as short. \r\n\r\nCoat: The coat on a Cavachon is usually fluffy, quite thick and curly. The Cavachon"s coat is very full and can grow to a length of 3-5 inches long. This breed sheds minimally and will be a great selection for those with allergy issues. The color of the Cavachon"s coat can vary a great deal due to the nature of the mix, however, shades of white or brown are the most common. Although, a solid peach color, tri-colored, sable and white and even black and tan are possible coat colors as well. \r\n\r\nCharacter: The Cavachon was created simply for the purpose of a friendly and loving companion with little to no shedding. This experiment was a great success, and now the Cavachon has become a quite popular breed. This breed is very gentle and good natured and will be quite happy with family life. The Cavachon is known to bark should a stranger come near, however, as they are quite good natured, they should not be depended upon as a watchdog. \r\n\r\nTemperament: The Cavachon is a very affectionate and gentle breed with a strong desire to please. This breed will do extremely well with children of all ages. The Cavachon is known to be very tolerable of play with small children. They also get along well with other family pets. However, as stated previously, the Cavachon is a mix of the Bichon Frise and the Cavalier King Charles. A mixed breed dog can have a combination of any of the temperament and characteristics of any breed involved. It is recommended that you thoroughly research all breeds involved in your mixed breed puppy to ensure that you are amenable and prepared for any of the possibilities.\r\n\r\nCare: The Cavachon is a relatively high maintenance breed. They will need to be brushed and bathed on a weekly basis to prevent matting in their curly coat. They will also require a trip to the groomer about every six weeks or so. Keep the areas under the eyes trimmed short as this helps in avoiding staining. The Cavachon sheds little and are a good choice for allergy sufferers. The Cavachon is an excellent breed for apartment dwellers, as they do not require a large amount of space to play. The Cavachon is well suited to most environments, but extra care should be taken in extreme cold. \r\n\r\nTraining: The Cavachon is very intelligent as well as eager to please. This makes them a very trainable breed. They will be quick to learn commands, but training should begin at an early age for the best results. As with any small breed dog, it is imperative that the Cavachon receive training from a firm and consistent, but not agressing, pack leader. The Cavachon could develop Small Dog Syndrome if allowed to believe that they are in charge. \r\n\r\nActivity: The Cavachon is not an extremely high energy dog.

Poodle crossbreeds are meant to produce a dog with mixed traits and the Poodleâ€™s signature nonshedding coat. Unlike many other Poodle crossbreeds, which tend to be recent, the Cockapoo was first developed as far back as the 1940â€™s. Like other crossbreeds, however, they have recently surged in popularity in America. The Cockapoo is also popular in Australia and Sweden, where it is known as the Spoodle. As a crossbreed, the Cockapoo is not eligible for registration with purebred registries such as the American Kennel Club, but it can be registered with the American Canine Hybrid Club, as â€˜Cock A Pooâ€™. The Cockapoo is not considered a purebred because it doesnâ€™t â€˜breed trueâ€™, meaning that it doesnâ€™t display a consistent set of characteristics. Some breeders produce Cockapoos by crossing a purebred Poodle with a purebred Cocker Spaniel (called a first generation cross), but others allow crossing Cockapoos with other Poodles or Cocker Spaniels (called a backcross), or with other Cockapoos (called a multi-generation cross). Different crosses can result in different characteristics. \r\n\r\nSize: The Cockapoo can come in a wide variety of sizes depending on the Poodle breed used. The Teacup Cockapoo (a cross between a Cocker Spaniel and Teacup Poodle) weighs 2-5 lbs (1-2 kg), the Toy Cockapoo weighs 5-12 lbs (2-5 kg), the Miniature Cockapoo weighs 12-20 lbs (5-9 kg), and the rare Standard Cockapoo weighs 20-65 lbs (9-29 kg). The Miniature Cockapoo is most common, with a shoulder height of 14-15 in (35-38 cm). Most have large, dark brown eyes and dark noses. Cockapoos may have docked tails.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Cockapoo has a coat which combines aspects of the Poodle and Cocker Spaniel coats. It may be very curly, flat, or anywhere in between. The Cockapoo can be a wide variety of colors such as white, cream, tan, or a mix thereof. A variety of coat colors and textures can appear in the same litter.\r\n\r\nCharacter: The Cockapoo is known for its pleasant temperament, loyalty and patience. Cockapoos are outgoing and eager for human companionship and attention. The Cockapoo will grow unhappy if it is left alone too often.\r\n\r\nTemperament: The Cockapoo"s kind disposition makes it an ideal family pet. The Cockapoo is gentle and loving with children and enjoys the company of all living things, including other dogs and pets.\r\n\r\nCare: Cockapoos do not shed much, however the coat does require extensive grooming. Like other hybrids, Cockapoos tend to have fewer health problems than most purebreds (known as â€˜hybrid vigorâ€™). Potential health problems are hip dysplasia (malformed hip joint which can cause lameness or arthritis), luxating patella (dislocated knee), ear infections, and eye problems such as PRA and cataracts.\r\n\r\nTraining: Cockapoos are intelligent and eager to please, which usually makes training a simple procedure. A consistent but not overly firm approach is required. House training the Cockapoo may be difficult.\r\n\r\nActivity: The Cockapoo has low exercise demands.

These dogs were bred for sheer fighting capacity, and they were famed for latching onto their prey with an iron jaw which they refused to releaseâ€”they could even suffocate opponents this way. English Bulldogs fell in popularity when bull baiting was outlawed in the 1830â€™s, but a committed group of devotees kept the breed alive and selected away any trace of ferocity. Easily recognizable by their distinctive and adorable â€˜sourmugâ€™, English Bulldogs serve as the mascots of dozens of sports teams, most famously Georgetown University.

The Pointer was bred from the Foxhound, Bloodhound, Greyhound, and Bull Terrier. By the 1700â€™s it had become popular for locating birds and silently pointing toward them until the hunter was ready to shoot (which could take a while with the firearms available at the time). Pointers were popular with the noble class for sport hunting on estates; often two Pointers were used, which allowed the hunter to locate birds more quickly and accurately by following both dogsâ€™ line of sight. The Westminster Kennel Club, which organizes what is widely considered to be Americaâ€™s most prestigious dog show, was formed in 1877 primarily to breed and display Pointers. A Pointer named â€˜Sensationâ€™ is its well known emblem. Today, Pointers are popular hunting dogs for bobwhite quail, pheasant, and woodcock, particularly in the American South, where they are sometimes called simply â€˜bird dogsâ€™. Pointers are also popular field competitors, but not common pets. Judy, a Pointer who served aboard a Royal Navy vessel during World War II, was known for pointing out approaching Japanese planes before the crew had observed their approach. After the ship was sunk and the crew became POWâ€™s, Judy assisted in smuggling the crew food and assisting where possible.

One Eskie named â€˜Stoutâ€™s Pal Pierreâ€™ became famous by walking the tightrope. Circuses popularized the breed by selling Eskie puppies after the show. The American Eskimo Dog was finally recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1994.\r\n\r\nSize: The standard American Eskimo Dog has a shoulder height of 38-48 cm (15-19 in) and weighs 9-16 kg (20-35 lbs). American Eskimo Dogs have a wedge shaped head and long, wolf-like muzzle. They have alert, triangular ears and black lips and nose. They are slightly longer than tall, with oval feet and bushy tails which hang over the back. \r\n\r\nCoat: The American Eskimo Dog has a two-layered coat. The undercoat is short and dense, and the outer coat consists of long straight hair. The coat is thicker and longer around the chest and neck, giving the appearance of a mane. American Eskimo Dogs must be white or biscuit cream--any other color is unacceptable.

It may bark at strangers, but it is not aggressive. \r\n\r\nCare: The American Eskimo Dog should be brushed regularly to prevent matting, more frequently when shedding. The coat should not be shaved as shaving irritates the skin. American Eskimo Dogs groom themselves frequently and thus only need to be bathed 4-5 times a year. Eskies require frequent human companionship. They are comfortable in cool environments but cannot tolerate heat. They are prone to hip dysplasia and may be allergic to fleas. American Eskimo Dogs have a life span of 10 to 15 years (some live up to 20) and litters of 4-6.\r\n\r\nTraining: American Eskimo Dogs learn quickly and are eager to please.

The Fila Brasileiro is a working breed and was primarily bred on livestock farms and plantations. The breed was primarily utilized to herd and guard livestock, but was also quite talented at hunting and tracking. The Fila Brasileiro, once it had located it"s prey, would take the animal down by the neck and hold it still until the hunter had arrived. The Fila Brasileiro was known for taking down not only cattle and other small animals, but larger game such as jaguars and even runaway slaves when it was still legal to own slaves in Brazil. The Fila Brasileiro became a registered breed by the Brazillian Confederation Kennel Club in 1946. Unfortunately, the Fila Brasileiro"s propensity towards aggression has caused the breed to become illegal in several countries including the United Kingdom, Israel, Denmark, Norway, Malta and Cyprus. Several other countries also have strict restrictions in regards to the Fila Brasileiro.\r\n\r\nSize: The Fila Brasileiro will typically reach heights of 25.5-29.5 inches and an average weight of 90-110 pounds.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Fila Brasileiro"s coat is a very distinct characteristic. The coat itself is short and smooth and sheds on an average basis, and the skin is very thick and loose. The loose skin is most pronounced at the neck and muzzle. The Fila Brasileiro can come in many color variations of nearly any color solid or brindle. The only color disqualifications are white, mouse gray, patched, dapple or black and tan. Varying levels of intensity in the brindle striping is acceptable. The most common coat colors are fawn, brindle and black with or without a black mask. It is permitted for a Fila Brasileiro to have white markings, however, they should be confined to the feet, chest and tip of the tail. Any white markings elsewhere on the body is undesirable. \r\n\r\nCharacter: The Fila Brasileiro is an extremely protective, loyal and faithful breed. They are regarded as excellent guard dogs that will jump to protect the family without hesitation. It is in the Fila Brasileiro"s nature to protect and they will not require training to do so. However, in turn you will not be able to train the protective instinct out of the Fila Brasileiro. The Fila Brasileiro is not for the inexperienced pet owner.

However, though the Fila Brasileiro loves his owner, he loves the rest of the family just as much. This breed is well known for fiercely loving the children in their family and are happy to take all the abuse they can give. They are also known to love and protect other non-canine family pets as well. The Fila Brasileiro, however, does not do well with strangers and will almost always be distrustful of them regardless of the level of socialization.

The Wire Fox Terrier was an early show dog which made its first appearance at the start of the 20th century, about 20 years after the Smooth Fox Terrier. Fox Terriers were recognized as one breed in 1885 by the American Kennel Club and accepted as two distinct breeds a century later.

Poodle crossbreeds are meant to produce a dog with mixed traits and the Poodleâ€™s signature nonshedding coat. Like all Poodle crosses, the Goldendoodle goes by many names, including the â€˜Goldipooâ€™, â€˜Goldenpooâ€™, â€˜Groodleâ€™, â€˜Curly Goldenâ€™, â€˜Goldenoodleâ€™, â€˜Goldoodleâ€™, or the somewhat less appealing â€˜Gopooâ€™. Like other â€˜designer breedsâ€™, the Goldendoodle has seen a recent surge in popularity. As a crossbreed, the Goldendoodle is not eligible for registration with purebred registries such as the American Kennel Club, but it can be registered with the American Canine Hybrid Club. The Goldendoodle is not considered a purebred because it doesnâ€™t â€˜breed trueâ€™, meaning that it doesnâ€™t display a consistent set of characteristics. Some breeders produce Goldendoodles by crossing a purebred Poodle with a purebred Golden Retriever (called a first generation cross), but others allow crossing Goldendoodles with Poodles or Golden Retrievers (called a backcross), or other Goldendoodles (called a multi-generation cross). Different crosses can result in different characteristics. \r\n\r\nSize: The Goldendoodle has an average shoulder height of 20-29 in (51-74 cm) and weighs 45-90 lbs (20-40 kg); mixes with Miniature Poodles or Toy Poodles tend to be smaller. As a crossbreed, the Goldendoodle has a wide variety of appearances. Those with more Poodle influence tend to have a thinner coat and shorter muzzle, whereas the Golden Retriever influence results in a wider neck, and longer muzzle. Goldendoodles can have short or long ears; most have a â€˜Vâ€™-shaped ridge from the forehead to the nose.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Goldendoodleâ€™s coat is a cross between the Golden Retriever and Poodle coat. It has fine hairs which appear quite thick. It can be curly or straight, most fall somewhere in the middle. Unclipped, the hair will grow about 4-7 in in length. Unlike the Poodle, the Goldendoodle should not be clipped any shorter than 2 in, as the coat provides natural protection in heat and cold. Depending on the Poodle influence, the Goldendoodle can come in a wide variety of colors including white, tan, chocolate, black, red, silver, or a mix thereof. A variety of colors and coat textures can appear in the same litter. Depending on the source breeds, the Goldendoodle may shed little to none like the Poodle or shed moderately like the Golden Retriever. Generally, the lower generations are better for allergy sufferers. Most Poodle crosses will go through various coat phases in their first year of life.\r\n\r\nCharacter: The Goldendoodle is intelligent, friendly, and family oriented. It is a highly social dog. Goldendoodles tend to follow their nose wherever it leads, so a fenced-in yard is recommended. They are always ready for a game; most Goldendoodles retain the natural retrieving instincts of the Golden Retriever. The Goldendoodleâ€™s friendliness with strangers makes it a poor watchdog. Goldendoodles do not bark frequently.\r\n\r\nTemperament: Goldendoodles love to be with their family. They are eager to please and get along well with children, other animals, and strangers. They are social dogs and crave being around people. \r\n\r\nCare: The Goldendoodle requires regular brushing or combing every few weeks. Goldendoodles have a lifespan of 9-15 years. They are prone to most health issues affecting Golden Retrievers and Poodles, including hip dysplasia (malformed hip joint which can cause lameness or arthritis), ear infections (particularly for longer-eared dogs) and eye problems such as cataracts, but as a mixed breed they are somewhat less likely to suffer health problems than purebreds (known as â€˜hybrid vigorâ€™).\r\n\r\nTraining: The Goldendoodle is intelligent and has a strong desire to please its master, making it highly trainable. Positive reinforcement is likely to be the most successful approach.\r\n\r\nActivity: The Goldendoodle requires a moderate amount of exercise. Most enjoy swimming as both the Poodle and Golden Retriever are not averse to water. Goldendoodles can live happily on a farm or in a big city. They will thrive with daily walks or play time.', 'DSCN3665.JPG', 'Goldendoodle', 'Country of Origin: The Goldendoodle is a cross between a Golden Retriever and a Poodle, a cross that originated in North America in the late 1990â€™s.

Like all Poodle crosses, the Goldendoodle goes by many names, including the â€˜Goldipooâ€™, â€˜Goldenpooâ€™, â€˜Groodleâ€™, â€˜Curly Goldenâ€™, â€˜Goldenoodleâ€™, â€˜Goldoodleâ€™, or the somewhat less appealing â€˜Gopooâ€™.

Whether he was the basis for bringing forth other gun breeds, or whether they simply sprang from common stock is not known. \r\n\r\nTEMPERAMENT\r\nThe Spinone has great strength and stamina, suited for hunting in all climates and on all terrains. Extremely intelligent, happy, upbeat and enthusiastic, the Spinone Italiano is a pleasant, easy-going breed. He is easily satisfied when treated as a lower ranking member of his human pack family. Although serious when at work in the field, he definitely has a clownish side that is often quite entertaining.

It was first bred in Australia in 1989 by breeder Wally Conron, who sought to create a dog with the Labradorâ€™s characteristic obedience and versatility and the Poodleâ€™s hypoallergenic coat. As a crossbreed, the Labradoodle is not eligible for registration with purebred registries such as the American Kennel Club, but it can be registered with the American Canine Hybrid Club. Some breeders produce Labradoodles by crossing a purebred Poodle with a purebred Labrador Retriever (called a first generation cross), but others allow crossing Labradoodles with Poodles or Labrador Retrievers (called a backcross), or other Labradoodles (called a multi-generation cross). Different crosses can result in different characteristics. Australian Labradoodles are considered a purebred by some as they have been bred for sufficient generations with sufficient stock (some also contain Cocker Spaniel or Irish Water Spaniel ancestry) to produce a suitably consistent offspring (called â€˜breeding trueâ€™). Like other â€˜designer breedsâ€™, the Labradoodle has seen a recent surge in popularity. These lovable dogs have become popular with many individuals, celebrity and everyman alike. Labradoodles have found their way into the homes of Tiger Woods, Jennifer Aniston, and Barbara Eden, star of I Dream of Jeannie, whose Labradoodle â€˜Djinn Djinnâ€™ was named after her invisible dog on the show. Other trends demonstrating the popularity of the Labradoodle are the inclusion of the word â€˜Labradoodleâ€™ in the Oxford English Dictionary, a Labradoodle figurine in the â€˜Here and Nowâ€™ edition of Monopoly, and the award winning â€˜Lucky the Incredible Wonder Pupâ€™ Labradoodle animated toy.\r\n\r\nSize: The Labradoodle has an average shoulder height of 13-26 in (33-66 cm) and weighs 22-88 lbs (10-40 kg). Labradoodles resulting from crosses with Toy Poodles are smaller than those resulting from crosses with Miniature or Standard Poodles. As a crossbreed, the Labradoodle may have a wide variety of features, but typical features are those listed in the Australian Labradoodle standard: a broad head with medium stop (depression where the muzzle meets the forehead), wide set eyes, flat ears level with the eyes, scissors bit, large nose, low set tail, and body slightly longer than tall. \r\n\r\nCoat: Due to the Poodle influence, the Labradoodle may have a wide variety of coats. The Labradoodle coat may be wiry or soft, straight or curly, or anywhere in between. There are a wide variety of possible Labradoodle colors, including white, cream, red, brown, black, and gold. First generation crosses shed lightly with a wispy hair coat, Second generation Labradoodles of primarily Poodle mixture are nonshedding with a fleece textured coat or hair coat, and higher generation Labradoodles are nonshedding with a fleece textured coat. The Australian variety is non-shedding with a fleece or wool textured coat. \r\n\r\nCharacter: The Labradoodle is friendly, family oriented, and lively. It is very clever, perky, and funny. Labradoodles love their family and are highly loyal. The Labradoodle will try to get away with mischief if its owner doesnâ€™t keep it in line.\r\n\r\nTemperament: Labradoodles are friendly with dogs, other pets and children.

Maltese do very well with other animals, but are often leery of strangers. The Shih Tzu is a medium sized and more sturdy breed with a double coat that is very people focused and literally thrives on attention and affection.

However, the breed as it is known today was developed in the American Southwest over the next few decades. The Australian dog was crossed with several breeds in an effort to produce an animal able to deal with the harsh temperatures and demands of the American West. Breeding during this period was mainly focused on abilityâ€”speed, agility, and endurance--rather than appearance, which delayed the Australian Shepherdâ€™s recognition as a breed. Australian Shepherds became popular pets after they were featured as rodeos performers in the 1950â€™s, and later in Disney films such as â€˜Run Appaloosa Runâ€™.

This is the case with the Morkie. \r\n\r\nTEMPERAMENT\r\nAs is the case with most other hybrid breeds, Morkie dogs are prone to taking on characteristics and personality traits from either parent breed or from both. Both the Yorkie as well as the Maltese are known for having a lot of personality, so it should not be a surprise that a Morkie would as well. Like Yorkies, Morkie dogs may crave and even demand attention from its family. Morkie dogs are also likely to be very dedicated to their family, which makes them ideal as family dogs as well as watch dogs. \r\n\r\nGROOMING\r\nMorkie dogs will usually have coats that are very soft. One of the advantages to Morkie dogs is that they are a low to non-shedding dog, but prospective owners should still be aware that Morkie dogs will need to either have a short haircut or be brushed daily. In addition, it will be important to be sure that the hair around the Morkieâ€™s eyes is kept clean on a regular basis. This will help to ensure that the hair does not build up around the eyes as well as to prevent dirt and debris from building up as well. \r\n\r\nHEALTH\r\nThe health of the Morkie dogs tends to be rather good although they may suffer from some of the same health issues as both parent breeds. These health concerns may include tracheal collapse, cataracts, medial patellar luxation, hydrocephalus, chronic valvular heart disease and glaucoma. If a prospective owner is concerned about the possibility of such health conditions, it is a good idea to research the dog"s parentage to find out whether there have been cases of such health issues and if so, the severity of those problems.

Without the intervention of dedicated breeders, it would be in danger of extinction. \r\n\r\nTEMPERAMENT\r\nThe Mudi is truly a rare dog. The few owners who employ and favor the Mudi find it incomparable. It has served as a flock guardian, sheep herder, cow herder, guard dog, hunter of wild animals, killer of mice and weasels and as a companion. This breed is highly intelligent, it can learn as quickly as a Border Collie or even faster. This dog is extremely powerful and courageous, is afraid of nothing, not even wild boar, which it can overpower quickly. It makes a good watchdog and guard dog; it will defend both property and person; it doesnâ€™t trust strangers. It is very loving and gentle in the family and makes an excellent companion dog.

The head is fairly broad and the body duly muscular. The jaw structure is more advanced than a Dingo"s. The hindquarters are lean and the medium-length tail is soft and fluffy. \r\n\r\nTemperament \r\nThe New Guinea Singing Dog is not like your average domesticated dog and is not recommended as a house pet for most people as they are closely related to wild dogs. If properly socialized, it can be tame enough to tolerate the handling of humans, getting attached to their owners. The NGSDs most unique characteristic is its dramatic ability to vary the pitch of its howl. They do not bark repetitively but have a complex vocal behavior including yelps, whines, and single-note howls. NGSDs are active, lively, and alert. They are constantly exploring everything in their environment, using all five senses, including taste. Their incredible structural flexibility allows them to pass their bodies through any opening wide enough to admit their head. Their hunting drive is very intense and may overwhelm any training when prey is detected. They use their acute sense of hearing in addition to sight and scent to locate prey. Although gentle and affectionate with people they know, they can be aloof with strangers. NGSDs can be aggressive toward other dogs, especially of the same sex. Its howl has an eerie yet synchronized quality, which gives the breed its name. The howl can be spurred when the dog is disturbed or excited. One tone blends with the next, sending goose bumps up a listener"s back. Opera singers have expressed a particular interest in this vocally skillful canine. This is a hardy and well-balanced dog.

The English Bulldog (or simply â€˜Bulldogâ€™) was bred in England for bull baiting, a popular gambling â€˜sportâ€™ in which one or more dogs were matched up against a chained bull (or bear). The Olde English Bulldogge is recognized by the APRI, CKC, OREBA, NKC, and CKC.

They are likely to drool or snore. \r\n\r\nCare: When the Olde English Bulldogge is shedding, use a rubber brush to remove dead hairs. The Olde English Bulldogge has a lifespan of 8-12 years. Due to its facial features, it is susceptible to breathing problems and skin infections, and many are delivered via Caesarean section because of the large head. Most Olde English Bulldogges cannot swim and are averse to hot weather.\r\n\r\nTraining: Consistency is important, but the Olde English Bulldogge is highly sensitive to the tone of its handler"s voice, making training a fairly simple process. It is inquisitive and quick to learn simple tasks, yet unpredictable as it is a bit stubborn on occasion.\r\n\r\nActivity: The exercise needs of the Olde English Bulldogge are uncomplicated.

The Medio Podengo Portugueso is a moderately-sized sighthound type with a well-proportioned head, flat skull and pronounced stop. The nose is usually brown, but may be black. The ears are large, naturally upright, triangular and highly mobile, turning forward to catch sound. The muzzle is straight. The chest is muscular and prominent. The small, oblique eyes are brown to honey in color. The cat-like feet have well arched toes with hard, strong pads. The back line only has a slight arch. The neck is strong and muscular without dewlap. When the dog is calm the tail hangs down, when the dog is excited or in motion the tail is horizontal. The coat comes in two varieties: smooth and wirehaired. The smooth coat is hard and longer than that of most sighthounds. The wirehaired coat is medium-long, shaggy and coarse.

This is an animated, happy, and alert dog with a good memory. It is a working dog at heart; it once watched over herds and flocks on the Polish plains. It is responsive to firm, fair obedience training; but it is also clever, strong-willed, and likes to think for itself and make its own decisions. This dog learns quickly and is very willing to please; however, it can be willful at times. Socialization at an early age is a must. This breed needs a firm and consistent owner. It has been known to get into mischief if left in the house alone too long. It is excellent with children when raised with them from puppyhood. It can be friendly with other dogs and usually does okay with other non-canine pets. The Polish Owczarek Nizinny is a serious, responsible dog, though it could bite if provoked. It makes an excellent watchdog and guard dog; it has been known to thwart even a bear to protect a child. It may nip at people"s heels, displaying herding behavior. As a working dog for many centuries, this dog is happiest when it is given a job to do; it is lively and clever enough to work sheep alone.

Poodle crossbreeds are meant to produce a dog with mixed traits and the Poodleâ€™s signature nonshedding coat. As a crossbreed, the Pomapoo is not eligible for registration with purebred registries such as the American Kennel Club, but it can be registered with the American Canine Hybrid Club, as â€˜Pom A Pooâ€™. The Pomapoo is not considered a purebred because it doesnâ€™t â€˜breed trueâ€™, meaning that it doesnâ€™t display a consistent set of characteristics. Like other â€˜designer breedsâ€™, the Pomapoo has seen a recent surge in popularity. Some breeders produce Pomapoos by crossing a purebred Poodle with a purebred Pomeranian (called a first generation cross), but others allow crossing Pomapoos with Poodles or Pomeranians (called a backcross), or with other Pomapoos (called a multi-generation cross). Different crosses can result in different characteristics. \r\n\r\nSize: The Pomapoo comes in a wide variety of sizes due to possible parentage by the Toy Poodle, Miniature Poodle, or Standard Poodle (though the latter is rare). The Miniature Pomapoo is most common, with a shoulder height of 8-12 in (20-30 cm) and a weight of 3-14 lbs (1-6 kg). Pomapoos can have a long, narrow muzzle like the Poodle or a wedge shaped head like the Pomeranian. They can have straight â€˜Poodle tailsâ€™ or the Pomeranianâ€™s characteristic high-set tail, carried over the back. Most Pomapoos have medium sized, â€˜Vâ€™-shaped ears, short neck, and straight back. The Pomapoo is longer than it is tall.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Pomapoo coat may be straight, curly, or anywhere in between, and may also vary from short to medium length. The Pomapoo may be a variety of colors including black, white, and brown (most common). Pomapoos of various coat texture, length, and color may be born in the same litter. The Pomapoo sheds little to none, like the Poodle. \r\n\r\nCharacter: The Pomapoo is intelligent, energetic, playful, loving, and loyal. Pomapoos are very devoted to their family; some develop separation anxiety and bark when they sense their owners are leaving. The Pomapoo craves attention, but if overly pampered it may become spoiled. \r\n\r\nTemperament: The Pomapoo gets along very well with children. Young children should be supervised around the Pomapoo to ensure they treat it with respect. Pomapoos are friendly with strangers, making poor watchdogs. Pomapoos get along very well with other dogs. Socialization when young is recommended for the Pomapoo.\r\n\r\nCare: The Pomapoo should be brushed daily to keep the coat knot and tangle free. Straight coats require less frequent brushing and trimming. The Pomapoo has a lifespan of 10-15 years and an average litter of six puppies. Like other hybrids, Pomapoos tend to have fewer health problems than purebreds (known as â€˜hybrid vigorâ€™). Potential health problems are luxating patella (dislocated knee), patent ductus arteriosus (a heart defect), collapsed trachea, and cataracts.\r\n\r\nTraining: The Pomapoo is intelligent and eager to please, making it easily trained. Positive reinforcement is best; harsh training methods will likely prove counterproductive.\r\n\r\nActivity: The Pomapoo requires a moderate amount of exercise.

Poodle crossbreeds are meant to produce a dog with mixed traits and the Poodleâ€™s signature nonshedding coat. As a crossbreed, the Schnoodle is not eligible for registration with purebred registries such as the American Kennel Club, but it can be registered with the American Canine Hybrid Club. The Schnoodle is not considered a purebred because it doesnâ€™t â€˜breed trueâ€™, meaning that it doesnâ€™t display a consistent set of characteristics. Some breeders produce Schnoodles by crossing a purebred Poodle with a purebred Schnauzer (called a first generation cross), but others allow crossing Schnoodles with Poodles or Schnauzers (called a backcross), or other Schnoodles (called a multi-generation cross). Different crosses can result in different characteristics. Like other â€˜designer breedsâ€™, the Schnoodle has seen a recent surge in popularity, even Hollywood celebrities such as Claire Danes and Dakota Fanning have succumbed to the Schnoodleâ€™s charm and found the need to pick one up.\r\n\r\nSize: The Schnoodle can vary substantially in height and weight as there are three recognized sizes of both the Poodle and Schnauzerâ€”Giant (Schnauzer), Standard (both), Miniature (both), and Toy (Poodle).

The Miniature Schnoodle is most common at 11-16 lbs (5-7 kg). \r\n\r\nCoat: The Schnoodle may have a rough and wiry coat, like the Schnauzer, or a soft Poodle coat, or any variation in between. Some have alternating patches of soft and coarse hair; coarse on the back and soft on the top of the head is common. There are a wide variety of possible colors, including black, brown, grey, white, apricot, or a mixture thereof. Common mixes include black and white, sable, and â€˜phantomâ€™ (black and tan like a Doberman Pinscher). Puppy Schnoodles in the same litter may have coats of different color and texture. The Schnoodle sheds little or not at all. \r\n\r\nCharacter: The Schnoodle has the Poodleâ€™s intelligence and the loyalty and devotion of the Schnauzer. It is alert, loving, and playful. The Schnoodle makes a good companion and family pet. It is smart enough to determine when youâ€™re preparing to leave, which will cause it to complain. Schnoodles may tend to bark frequently or dig if not trained otherwise.\r\n\r\nTemperament: The Schnoodle gets along well with children, strangers, dogs, and other pets. The Schnoodle is a typically happy breed which enjoys being with its family. \r\n\r\nCare: The Schnoodle requires only a weekly brushing and grooming a few times a year.

Some have allergies. The Schnoodle may require a special diet; consult your veterinarian for information. The Toy Schnoodle may have dental problems which can be prevented by frequent tooth brushing.

Some believe the Thai Ridgeback is a descendant to the Rhodesian Ridgeback based on the theory that all African breeds descend from Asian breeds. Another possibility is that the ridge originated in Africa from the African Hottentott Hunting dog. DNA studies are being conducted to investigate the relationship of the three breeds. In any case, the Thai Ridgeback was common in Thailand by the mid-1600â€™s, where it was used as a watchdog and escort. The Thai Ridgeback has changed little since the 1600â€™s due to the isolated nature of Thailand. Efforts to standardize and preserve the breed began in Thailand in the 1970â€™s. The number of Thai Ridgebacks in Thailand has increased substantially, and the breed is growing, but still very rare, in Europe and America. PLEASE NOTE: This breed has been accepted for recording in the AKC Foundation Stock Service (FSS). This is simply an avenue to maintain reputable records regarding the breedâ€™s development.

Some Thai Ridgebacks have a solid black or black spotted tongue. Thai Ridgebacks are muscular with a flat back and sickle-curved tail carried high.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Thai Ridgeback has a short, hard, dense, smooth coat which can be blue, black, beige, red, fawn, brindle, or white, the last two of which are not acceptable in the show ring. Its coat grows longer in winter. The Thai Ridgebackâ€™s defining feature is the ridge down its back from the shoulder to the hips, composed of hair running in a different direction to the rest of the coat. The ridge pattern is classified into eight categoriesâ€”they are (from thinnest to widest) needle, arrow, feather, violin, lute, bowling pin, leaf, and saddleback.\r\n\r\nCharacter: The Thai Ridgeback is smart, obedient and watchful.

Like many Poodle crossbreeds, it is known by many names, such as Malte Poo, Malta Poo, Multa Poo, Moodle, Malti Doodle, Maltese Poodle, or even Malt Oodles. Unlike other Poodle mixes, the Malti Poo cross is made to create a distinct appearance, rather than to provide the Poodleâ€™s hypoallergenic coat, as the Maltese itself sheds little and is good for allergy sufferers. As a crossbreed, the Malti Poo is not eligible for registration with purebred registries such as the American Kennel Club, but it can be registered with the American Canine Hybrid Club as Malt-a-Poo. Some breeders produce Malti Poos by crossing a purebred Poodle with a purebred Maltese (called a first generation cross), but others allow crossing Malti Poos with Poodles or Maltese (called a backcross), or other Malti Poos (called a multi-generation cross). Different crosses can result in different characteristics. The Malti Poo has won over celebrities and the masses alike with its distinctive charm. Jessica Simpsonâ€™s Malti Poo â€˜Daisyâ€™ was featured on the reality TV show â€˜Newlyweds: Nick and Jessicaâ€™. Other celebrity Malti Poo owners include Ellen DeGeneres and Carmen Electra.\r\n\r\nSize: The Malti Poo comes in a wide variety of sizes, but most are 6-15 in (15-38 cm) at the shoulders and weigh 5-15 lbs (2-7 kg). A Malti Poo with more Maltese influence will have a domed skull, whereas a Malti Poo with a higher Poodle influence will have the long, narrow muzzle characteristic of Poodles.\r\n\r\nCoat: The Malti Poo coat can range from the silky texture of the Maltese coat to the Poodleâ€™s distinctive frizzy coat. It can be many colors including grey, black, white, and apricot. Most Malti Poos shed little or none and are a good match for allergy sufferers. Many Malti Poos are kept in a short â€˜puppy cutâ€™. Some Malti Poos are kept with a longer coat, with the hair tied in a bow above the eyes.\r\n\r\nCharacter: The Malti Poo is an intelligent, loving dog. The mix of Maltese and Poodle usually produces a lively, playful dog devoted to its family. The Malti Poo loves to play or curl up on the couch for a nap. Malti Poos require frequent human companionship.\r\n\r\nTemperament: The Malti Poo can get along well with dogs and other pets if socialized when young, but it is somewhat territorial. Malti Poos may be wary of strangers and are highly protective of their family. Malti Poos get along very well with children, but should be supervised around young children to ensure they are treated respectfully.\r\n\r\nCare: The Malti Poo sheds little or no hair. It requires monthly grooming and regular brushing to prevent tangling. The eyes and ears should also be cleaned regularly with stray hairs removed. Bathe only when necessary. Puppies should not be handled constantly as they need time to rest and relax. The Malti Poo has a lifespan of 11-13 years. Malti Poos may be susceptible to health problems affecting the parent breeds, such as heart issues, dental problems (frequent tooth brushing can help), and bloat, though they are somewhat less likely to suffer these conditions then purebred Poodles or Maltese (known as â€˜hybrid vigorâ€™). Bloat can be prevented by feeding from a raised dish, spacing meals throughout the day, and avoiding exercise immediately after meals.\r\n\r\nTraining: The Malti Poo is eager to learn and should not present many difficulties in training. Positive reinforcement is likely to be the most successful approach. This breed may take a while to house train. Like the Maltese, many Malti Poos are paper or box trained rather than â€˜outdoorâ€™ trained.\r\n\r\nActivity: The Malti Poo can have most of its exercise needs met by indoor play and activities, but it also enjoys walks or playtime in the yard.

These dogs were bred for sheer fighting capacity, and they were famed for latching onto their prey with an iron jaw which they refused to releaseâ€”they could even suffocate opponents this way. English Bulldogs fell in popularity when bull baiting was outlawed in the 1830â€™s, but a committed group of devotees kept the breed alive and selected away any trace of ferocity. Easily recognizable by their distinctive and adorable â€˜sourmugâ€™, English Bulldogs serve as the mascots of dozens of sports teams, most famously Georgetown University. Famous English Bulldogs include Handsome Dan, the Yale mascot, and Tyson, the skateboarding Bulldog of internet fame. Miniature Bulldogs are simultaneously a symbol of British tenacity and an immensely popular American pet. PLEASE NOTE: Also classified as a Miniature Bulldog is the English Bulldog or Olde English Bulldogge and Pug cross. A mixed breed dog can have a combination of any of the temperament and characteristics of any breed involved. It is recommended that you thoroughly research all breeds involved in your mixed breed puppy to ensure that you are amenable and prepared for any of the possibilities. The designer cross is recognized by the American Canine Hybrid Club, Designer Dogs Kennel Club and Designer Breed Registry.\r\n\r\nSize: The Miniature Bulldog has a shoulder height of 10-12 in (25-30 cm) and weighs 11-18 kg (25-40 lbs). It is known for its short, wide muzzle, undershot jaw, and wide, droopy face giving the appearance of a frown. Miniature Bulldogs have short legs and tails, rounded chests, and compact, muscular bodies. \r\n\r\nCoat: The Miniature Bulldog has a short, smooth, glossy coat which can be beige, mottled, brindle, or white.\r\n\r\nCharacter: The Miniature Bulldog is affectionate, uncomplicated, gentle, intelligent, sensitive, and fearless. The Miniature Bulldog is known for its loyalty; its happy-go-lucky attitude is in sharp contrast to its sour face. Miniature Bulldogs are happiest by their ownerâ€™s side and will misbehave if ignored. Miniature Bulldogs are active, alert, and playful, but not unduly boisterous.\r\n\r\nTemperament: Miniature Bulldogs enjoy mixing with other dogs and household pets. They are great with children, well behaved, adaptable, comfortable companions with an affectionate nature and even disposition. Some Miniature Bulldogs are cautious with strangers, but most are friendly to everyone. They are likely to drool or snore. \r\n\r\nCare: When the Miniature Bulldog is shedding, use a rubber brush to remove dead hairs. A special lotion will occasionally need to be applied to the facial and tail folds to keep them clean; soft tooth brushing with an approved toothpaste is also recommended. The Miniature Bulldog has a lifespan of 8-12 years. Due to its facial features, it is susceptible to breathing problems and skin infections, and many are delivered via Caesarean section because of the large head. Most Miniature Bulldogs cannot swim and are averse to hot weather.\r\n\r\nTraining: Consistency is important, but the Miniature Bulldog is highly sensitive to the tone of its handler"s voice, making training a fairly simple process. It is inquisitive and quick to learn simple tasks, yet unpredictable as it is a bit stubborn on occasion.\r\n\r\nActivity: The exercise needs of the Miniature Bulldog are uncomplicated. It will adapt itself to the activity level of your family. Sufficient rest is key to development of healthy bones, muscles, and jointsâ€”do not expect your Miniature Bulldog to run long distances or jump down from tall ledges.
